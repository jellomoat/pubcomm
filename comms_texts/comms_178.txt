Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council 

Western States Legal Foundation  based in Oakland  is a nonprofit  tax  exempt organization
established in 1982 to provide legal support for nonviolent protesters challenging the construction of
the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant  While our efforts over the years have focused primarily on
advocacy for the elimination of nuclear weapons  we remain firmly opposed to nuclear power for
many reasons  The ongoing dire situation at Fukushima Daiichi is one of them 

We write in support of Council member Kate Harrison s  Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric 
Power Company and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean 

The Japanese Government and TEPCO  Tokyo Electric Power Company  are planning to discharge 
over  3 million tons of treated water from the Advanced Liquid Processing System stored in tanks on
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant site into the Pacific Ocean for more than 40 years  starting
as soon as this summer  As a result  dangerous radionuclides could flow across the ocean to Russia 
Alaska  Canada  Hawaii  and the U S  West Coast   

There is no precedent in Japan or any other country for a  disposal method  such as  treating  a large
amount of radioactively contaminated water generated from contact with molten fuel debris at a
nuclear reactor after a severe accident  There is no previous experience in diluting such water with an
even more enormous amount of seawater  then systematically releasing it into the ocean over several
decades  This treated water will contain more than 60 radionuclides  including carbon 14  cesium 137
and strontium 90  which the Advanced Liquid Processing System cannot altogether remove 

 
Intentionally discharging radioactive water into the ocean is contrary to the intent of the London
Convention and London Protocol  to which Japan is a party  Such a discharge also violates the human
rights of people not only in Japan but also in many other countries that share the Pacific Ocean  UN  
Special Rapporteurs have expressed concern that this decision could threaten human health and the
environment  ltt   

  The Pacific Islands Forum  a regional bloc of 18 island nations  has raised concerns about the release of
the radioactively contaminated water  including its impact on fisheries  Just today  at a meeting held in
the Cook Islands between Pacific Island leaders and the Director General of the International Atomic
Energy Agency  Rafael Grossi  Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown told the participants that the
Pacific s nuclear testing legacy continues to affect its people and ocean  eight decades on  The
dumping of massive quantities of radioactive water into the ocean would add insult to injury 

In December 2022  the U S  National Association of Marine Laboratories  an association of over 100
laboratories  issued a Position Paper titled   Scientific opposition to Japan s planned release of over 1 3
million tons of radioactively contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
disaster into the Pacific Ocean  The statement begins   

 The National Association of Marine Laboratories  NAML  an organization of more than 100 member
laboratories  opposes Japan s plans to begin releasing over 1 3 million tons of radioactively
contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean  
commencing in 2023  This opposition is based on the fact that there is a lack of adequate and accurate
_ scientific data supporting Japan s assertion of safety  Furthermore  there is an abundance of data
demonstrating serious concerns about releasing radioactively contaminated water   

The statement concludes with a rational  scientifically responsible recommendation 

 We urge the Government of Japan to stop pursuing their planned and precedent setting release of the
radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean and to work with the broader scientific
community to pursue other approaches that protect ocean life  human health  and those communities

who depend on ecologically  economically  and culturally valuable marine resources 

We agree with this recommendation and urge the Berkeley City Council to go on record against
Japan s planned release of radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean 

Thank you for your consideration 

Jacqueline Cabasso  Executive Director  Western States Legal Foundation
