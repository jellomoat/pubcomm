Dear Mayor and Council 

I ve spent considerable time out in our city parks over the last few weeks and this is what   heard from children
 and their parents  First of all Strawberry Creek Park was the most popular and most highly utilized of the parks
visited  Children love the creek  Their parents told me how their children want to come to the creek to play 
And play they did   

  was surprised with the number of people from neighboring cities who visit Berkeley City Parks and again 
visitors from other cities  chose Strawberry Creek in much higher numbers  Besides the creek and play area 
the cafe was a big draw for visitors 

My experience of observing and listening matched the reports  studies and articles    found online under the
search  community impact of daylighting creeks  Daylighting creeks has an enormously positive impact on
attracting people  especially families with children  More than that daylighting creeks brings economic
benefits  restores habitat and ecosystems  and is listed under actions for resilient cities 

Please support the alternative design and change the    partial flow  to support a full flow restoration of
Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park
