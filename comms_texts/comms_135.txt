Dear Mayor and City Council 
Please refer to the transcript below of this past Saturday  July 8  2023 PBS interview which identifies the
disproportionately high rate of California homelessness not only among those over 50  many of whom have worked

physically demanding low paying jobs  and the disproportionate rate of persons who are not only black but also Native
American  Please consider the disparities of Native Americans in housing preference 

Thank you 

Carole Marasovic

Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution to create an Affordable Housing Preference Policy applicable to new residential housing units created via the Below Market-Rate (BMR) and the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) programs consistent with Fair Housing law and government funder approvals, and direct the City Manager to adopt guidelines to administer the Housing Preference Policy.
