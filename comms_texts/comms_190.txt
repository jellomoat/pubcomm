Dear Mayor Arreguin and Members of the City Council 

Volunteers at Restore Strawberry Creek  polled Berkeley residents and park users and found
overwhelming enthusiasm for daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  Please take a
moment to review the responses and comments to see just how excited people are about
opening up the creek in the heart of the City 

And as a reminder  Restore Strawberry Creek  is actively seeking the funding necessary to
make the daylighting a reality and ask for a simple  but formal  acknowledgement that the Plan
would allow for a  full flow  restoration of Strawberry Creek  As we have demonstrated in
previous correspondence  a full flow restoration would allow for many  if not most  activities
considered in the Plan  Describing the daylighted creek as a  partial flow  restoration as the
Plan now states  could hamper our ability to attract state funding 

Sincerely 

Tom Kelly
Restore Strawberry Creek

 I love nature  daylighting the creek would be a great asset for the downtown    Kelly  

 Daylighting other areas of the Creek  Strawberry Creek Park  has been very successful 
beautifying and enlivening the Park and restoring natural habitat to that area  The same could
be possible with Civic Center Park  Bonnie  

 To increase the health of our watershed  give all people access to a beautiful creek  and
increase biodiversity    Chase

 As stewards  we should have a relationship to our water and watersheds  this could create
many more opportunities  William  

 Strawberry Creek Park is our favorite Berkeley park  We like to watch the creek play over the
rocks and we love to see children enjoying it  So we d love to see the same creek appear in
Downtown Berkeley    Nancy

 It will create biodiversity  attract visitors and children and honor indigenous people    Sylvia
 Biodiversity  open space  habitat    Tom and Jane

 Creeks should not have been buried to begin with  Our ecosystems have been severely
impacted and efforts to restore full creek flow on the surface are honestly imperative  Creeks

  draw everyone to their side as it is in the DNA of homo sapiens to respond positively to the flow
of water    Elizabeth

 A creek buried underground does not support the habitat that would thrive around it were it
opened to the sky  Things die when they enter the dark dead zone    Kathleen

 It would be a great amenity to city residents  encourage people to appreciate creeks and offer
opportunities for Berkeley High and other young people to get involved    Dale

 4 will make the park  and the city  more enjoyable and beautiful    Jeff

 We need to daylight Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  The creek was the primary water
source for key parts of Berkeley  The history and development of Berkeley is closely linked with
Strawberry Creek  It should no longer be hidden  It should rightfully be daylighted and
celebrated in the primary civic heart of our city    Mukul

 Enhances the downtown area  provides green space for people to enjoy  piemaee habitat for
wildlife    Margot  

 An environmentally and culturally positive action that will bring joy and delight to our
community    Miranda 

 The open  flowing creek will add a cool  natural presence that makes the park an exceptional
place people will want to come to  And it will symbolize our City s ecological values    Stephen

 Daylighting the creek in Civic Center Park will greatly improve our ability to physically reconnect
with what is essential in all of our lives  water  A place in the center of Berkeley where we can
enjoy watching and listening to a fully flowing creek will greatly enhance our sense of well being
both as individuals  and as members of a thriving community  Just think of the many species of

birds and butterflies that will be flying near the flowing creek  Families and folks of all ages and
eapenionoes will benefit  Such joy    Sally

 t will add some beautiful space to an otherwise increasingly anti human environment    Bernard
 The daylit parts of the creek in the UC campus look great and immensely adds to the quality of
campus experience    think if we could daylight creeks all the way fo the bay  it would look great
and immensely add to the quality of life in Berkeley    Alan

 It would enhance the park tremendously    Sheila

 Will increase species diversity and science education     rene

 It s a shame it was buried in the first place  Let s restore Berkeley s natural beauty  and provide
a resource for people and wildlife alike    Molly

 Creeks are beautiful  they support life  and may help prevent building and flooding problems in
the long run    Mary Lynn

 There is no better design for a city than to allow its natural waterways  As Berkeley packs in
more residents  we also need a bit of real nature    Carolyn

 For environmental restoration and climate change resilience  for a vibrant community center 
which celebrates nature and well being  for economic resilience  bringing a much needed
anchor and draw to the downtown core  to provide a place where all people  of any age or
demographic  can come together and enjoy nature and art and history around our diverse local
and regional cultures    Juliet

 As development continues there are so few places where students and residents can enjoy
what nature offers  This is particularly true in Berkeley where things are so built up    Mary

 The natural flow of Strawberry Creek through Civic Center Park would be a welcome addition
to the small park and provide an opportunity for Berkeley High School students to study a creek
very close by Helga  

 For beauty  for health  for biodiversity  for education  for restoration of the natural environment 
    Summer

 It would be beneficial for all    Pierre  

 Nature    Mike

 It will reinvigorate the park and connect the urban environment to nature    Sas

 It s the right thing to do  preserving the past is a good thing    Michael

 It s increasingly important for cities to preserve elements of nature for the benefit of their
inhabitants  Research has demonstrated unequivocally that humans need contact with our
natural world for both physical  mental  and emotional health  Flowing water supports a diversity

of birds and beneficial insects and is a soothing element in a park    Charlene

 It would may the area more inviting    Imtiaz
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
