BACKGROUND

The current statewide curricula that covers the life and work of labor and environmental
organizers  César Chavez and Dolores Huerta  does not adequately cover their rich
legacies nor their direct impact on Berkeley  However  new lesson plans developed as
part of the  Cesar Chavez Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project  will include
both in class and experiential learning at the tribute site on the waterfront at Berkeley s
César Chavez Park  The founders of the curriculum project  Santiago Casal and Beatriz
Levya Cutler  aim to  honor the equitable relationship  work and words of César and
Dolores and others in the farmworker struggle  The synergy of their partnership is what
made them highly effective 

Casal and Levya Cutler plan to apply for the Berkeley Public Schools Fund grant 
LEARNING for Equity  which provides  1 000    15 000 grants to projects focused on
addressing systemic oppression through strategic  justice oriented programming  This
funding would allow complete curriculum implementation across Berkeley schools by
Spring 2024  The funds provided by Council discretionary budgets  will help provide
supplemental compensation for teacher leaders who will utilize summer 2023 to develop
prototypes and recruit grade level teacher consultants  It is in the public interest to
donate to this project which serves the fundamental  municipal purpose of education

BACKGROUND

The Chavez Huerta Tribute Site  located at Cesar Chavez Park along Spinnaker Way 
is centered around a lush green space overlooking the Bay Area  Instead of a single
statue or monument for the farmworker and labor organizer by which the park is named
after  the site has intentionally developed a comprehensive urban solar lunar calendar 
along with a quartet of stones engraved with four virtues of the Farmworkers Movement 
Determination  Courage  Hope  and Tolerance  The site draws from design concepts in
art  astronomy  and architecture found at ancient and indigenous sky observatory sites
from around the world  The site seeks to promote an understanding of the Rhythm of

  the Seasons  the work  life  and values of Cesar E  Chavez and Dolores Huerta  provide
an outdoor classroom to study science  math  and culture  and create a space for
reflection and peace along the Berkeley shoreline  The site also contains a virtual tour 
which can be activated using your mobile device  and a physical  self explanatory sign
to assist visitors with utilizing the solar calendar and position of stones to understand its
relationship to solstice and equinox 

A sum of  5 000 is being sought by the caretakers of the Chavez Huerta Tribute Site to
go towards fees associated with employing gardeners  hauling soil  conducting stone
replacement  composting goods  grounds maintenance  upgrading signage  and paying
the Kala Art Institute a fiscal agent fee
