Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan  One of the most
important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park    ask for
your full support 

The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an  alternate scenario   
using the term  partial flow creek bed    ask you to change the description of the  alternate design 
from just a  partial flow  to supporting a full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center
Park  It can be done while still supporting the other important park uses and activities  Thank you 

Michael Weber
