Subject  In support of the Resolution  Consent Item  29  Opposing Tokyo Electric Power

Company and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from
 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is

My name is Tsukuru Fors    am an anti nuclear human rights activist based in Los Angeles  California    grew
up in Hiroshima  Japan  and am a graduate of a high school where 350 young lives were brutally taken on
August 6  1945  Spending my formative years surrounded by people who were directly affected by the
intergenerational traumas of the atrocity has prompted me to advocate for all victims of nuclear disasters
globally in the past and present 

  have been made aware of the recent efforts to discredit a resolution championed by councilmember Kate
Harrison to oppose TEPCO the government of Japan s plan of dumping radioactive wastewater from the
crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  In the letter that was addressed to city council members to
discourage them from voting yes on the resolution  the recent approval issued by the IAEA  International
Atomic Energy Agency  was cited    felt the need to respond to that   

  am not going to debate the validity of the IAEA report approval here  Rather  once again   would like to cite
the findings published by a board of five experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum  The findings
point out that TEPCO has neither done enough due   diligence nor yr provided enough data to ascertain the safety
of the proposed plan 

Among the critical failings with TEPCO s  safety  claim  two things stand out to me  One is their lack of analysis
with regards to the transboundary issues  Wastewater released by Japan is not going to stay in and around
Japan  therefore  the concerns of neighboring nations such as South Korea  the Philippines  China  and the
Pacific Island nations should be seriously considered in the decision making process  Moreover  the potential  
risks are not limited to the Asia Pacific region  A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported
radionuclides from Fukushima across the Pacific to California 

The other is the matter of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration  Radionuclides such as Tritium and Strontium
90 can pass various levels of the food chain and be  bio accumulated  The higher up the food chain  the
higher the level of the contamination  In fish like Cod that are relatively high up in the food chain  the
concentration can be 2 000 6 000 times higher than the level naturally found in the water  TEPCO s claim does
not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT  Organically Bound Tritium  on a human body  either 
once it enters the body  OBT can replace water in soft tissues  causing damage to DNA and cell mutations 
Because of these failings  experts like Robert H  Richmond  director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa and who is among the board of experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands
Forum  are calling the plan  ill advised  and premature 

Lastly    would like to appeal to the moral and ethical responsibility that we have  as citizens of the United
States  to the people of the Pacific Island nations and future generations worldwide  The question that   want
us to ask ourselves is this  should we be treating the oceans as a dumping ground  Haven t the world s oceans
been polluted and stressed enough  The people of the Pacific Island nations have been victimized for decades
by the nuclear ambitions of more  powerful  nations  For Japan to release wastewater from the damaged

f

 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is a gross disregard for their livelihood and ocean way of life  For us 
citizens of the United States  not to oppose such a plan is to be complicit in the act of nuclear colonialism 

  was born and raised in Japan but immigrated to the United States of America    have raised my child here and
enjoyed the beaches and the ocean as a resident of California  It is my obligation to do everything in my power
to protect the environment and leave it as clean as possible for future generations    am pleading to you 
honorable members of the Berkeley City Council  to act on your conscience and to do your part in being good
stewards of our planet 

Sincerely 

Tsukuru Fors

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
