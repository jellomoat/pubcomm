Dear Members of Berkeley s City Council 

As you discuss the high level design concept of Civic Center Phase II  please support a full flow restoration of Strawberry
  Creek in Civic Center Park  This can be done while supporting other identified park uses and activities  This will greatly
benefit Berkeley s entire community 

With sincere thanks
