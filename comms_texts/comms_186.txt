Re  Restore Strawberry Creek  Item  33   Civic Center Phase II   Design Concept Adoption

 Dear Honorable Mayor   City Council Members 

Our organization has been working to restore habitat by planting pollinator gardens in Berkeley Parks including Strawberry Creek
Park  From our work in the park  we have witnessed first hand how the daylighted section of Strawberry Creek brings about so
much vibrancy and life to the park and community  Children gleefully flock to it  while parents relax and picnic nearby  Birds flutter 
about splashing in the creek  while iridescent dragonflies hover before dipping down for a drink 

  The successful daylighting of the creek in Strawberry Creek Park decades ago did not happen without concerns  City officials were
apprehensive about the project  ex  feasibility  cost  flooding  safety issues  trash  crime etc 1  but somehow the community vision
prevailed  Visit the park and creek today and you ll be stunned by its natural beauty and popularity 

Daylighting creeks can offer transformational change to urban areas  2  and is a direct way to connect with nature  supports
biodiversity  honors indigenous land and rights of nature  3  offers educational opportunities  can bring in revitalization and
revenue  to name a few of the many benefits 

 N
On July 11  2023 you will have the opportunity to consider the approval of the Civic Center Plan 

The daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park is one of the most important elements of the Plan that we are asking you
to fully support 

We ask that the proposed Design for the creek not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the creek at this early stage
in the planning process  The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an  alternate scenario  using
the term  partial flow creek bed 

A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what s possible and would be more likely to secure funding 

Therefore  Transition Berkeley asks you to change the description of the  alternate design  from just a  partial flow  to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  We believe It can be done while still supporting the other important
park uses and activities 

We ve experienced the success of daylighting the creek in Strawberry Creek Park and know that many other cities have enjoyed the
benefits of daylighting creeks in their downtown urban settings  2 

Let s stay open to the possibility of daylighting the creek in Civic Center Park  while allowing full planning and design studies to
proceed 

Warm regards
