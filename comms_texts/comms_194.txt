Subject  Two things  Auditors Report and Civic Center Park

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the

Dear Mayor Arreguin and Berkeley City Council Members 

First  Berkeley Auditor Jenny Wong has produced a first rate report on issues around Berkeley
City Staff and the implementation and non   completion of mandated recommendations 

  hope that the Mayor and Council will become more pro active in holding the City Manager to an
implementation and reporting schedule 

Second  in response to the consultant report on Civic Center Park    need to  once again  convey
my disappointment and distress 

1  The Report simply does not engage the costs of renovation of either the Maudelle
Shirek Old City Hall or the Veterans Building  It has been reasonably established that these costs
could run upward of  80 million 

Is the City Council  given all the other infrastructure issues in BEER y prepared to go
ahead with this proposed expenditure 

2  The Report simply does not make an argument for building a new City Council Chamber
in the Civic Center  It does not even pretend to do a  cost benefit  analysis as to why it is necessary
or appropriate to move the Council meeting from their current location in the BUSD facility 

3  There is a proposal for daylighting a portion of Strawberry Creek through the Park  but
no assessment of either the current condition of the culvert OR the effect of splitting the park in two
by virtue of the daylighting 

In short  there are all sorts of recommendations but these recommendations are indifferent to
costs and vague in presumed benefits 

My view is that Civic Center Park is  underused  except for special occasions because of its
location and surroundings  But that s a different discussion 

The consultant report is profoundly dishonest and disingenuous  Please scrap it

Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
