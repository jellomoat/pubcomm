Subject  Support for Kate Harrison s Fukushima Opposition

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe 
Dear Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council 

  am writing to express my strong support for councilmember Kate Harrison s Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power
Company  TEPCO  and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on today s agenda at Berkeley City Council 

Untrustworthy players
As we know  the Fukushima incident was preventable  but happened due to bad decisions and poor leadership  all you

have to do is google  was Fukushima preventable  to see the multitud of evidence  Sadly  in more than a decade since 
TEPCO has still not changed  In the 18 months that the expert panel has reviewed TEPCO s data  they ve been disturbed

by the poor data collection methods  data that don t line up with science  and obfuscation by the authorities 

Unfortunately  the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  both promotes nuclear energy  and is its own watchdog 
An inherent conflict of interests  Also  about 10  of the IAEA s operating budget comes from Japan  and did in 2021  see
page 131  So the IAEA cannot be trusted to be unbiased in this case 

Outdated safety standards

As we have worked directly with the third panel party of experts  they keep hammering this home  the safety standards
are not in line with the latest science  The IAEA s safety standards for tritium don t make a distinction between
men and women  there is one estimate for generic  adults  which shows its safety standards are also
discriminatory against women  AND the most recent data and research they cite is from 2004  nearly twenty
years ago  Yet we know that women and children are more sensitive to the effects of radiation  US drinking

water s standard limit was set without detailed assessment of what it would take to protect the embryo or the
fetus  especially in the first trimester 

Common sense  safer alternatives  

  The scientific community agrees we cannot keep dumping waste in our environment  Especially when  in TEPCO s case 
the waste can be made into cement  safely stored  and actually used for ongoing construction on site  We must follow
the Precautionary Principle  This is such a no brainer  it hurts 

Many parts of the US and California look to Berkeley as a shining example of how to push past outdated view  laws  and
science  as Berkeley shepherds in progressive laws and policies that the rest of California follows 

  trust that you ll vote to uphold public and environmental health and safety in this case 

Here is more reference material from the expert panel 

Thank you for your time  and important work 
Eva

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
