Subject  Item 35 and Psilocybin  A suicide attempt following psilocybin ingestion in a patient

with no prior psychiatric history

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe 
Dear Mayor and Council 

Psilocybin is not an FDA approved substance  Therefore  there is no Safety or Efficacy profile of the drug 

However  suicidal ieee and suicidal attempts have been reported in the literature  Including this report from June
2023 

There are many other serious safety signals associated with psilocybin that have been reported in the literature as
well  Are you going to warn people with epilepsy or who are on antidepressants not to use it  How about those with

heart disease  If you don t  you might be liable 

You are embarking ona very dangerous path if you deprioritize the enforcement of laws for psilocybin  Several of you
are attorneys and should know better  None of you have any medical training to speak of 

How many more psychiatrically unstable people do we need walking our streets

From Eid  OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK

y CITY OF BERKELEY
es Mayor we applied as soon as Dionne Early posted the space few month ago  but beside that
we have applied for the lease in August 2020 when you offered the space as a lease pending a
license  next day after that Liam Garland called me at 9 AM  telling me he was getting the place
ready for us  and he will have Dionne Early prepare the paperwork next day you called me  and
seemed upset about Dionne Early objection  Liam Garland called me as well and asked to meet
Dionne and sweet talk her    talked to her on the phone several times  expressing the urgency
of our situation as our current building was in the proccess of being demolished    we had
several talks on the phone  the last time when she came by our old location at 2556 Telegraph
avenunue  again   had hard time convincinng her of the uregency of our situation  we then had
very large inventory  as well as dozens of display cabinets and fixtures  in fact while Dionne
Early were talking the demolition workers began demolishing the roof  above our head and big
chunks of the roof fell all around us    stood up quickly and held Dionne by her hand and both of
us as well as my employees ran out of the store to street  That was very  scary and dangerous
situation    believe that the developer Aaran Keifer told the demolishers to start to tear the
building down even though he knew we were still inside  we lost over ten thousands dollars of
damage products  including Televisions and other electronics merchandise Aran Kiefer talk
to you couple of times  but his action on our final days at 2556 Telegraph was wrong As far
as the application we have excellent credit and we have been in business over 50 years as  
established the business on May 1973 while   was full time graduate student at U C Berkeley
Nuclear Engineering department  by 1978 when   finished my PHD  Eids Television annual gross
sales exceeded 12 million dollars    did continue my academic life by teaching at Cal for several
years and over one decade at National University in Cupertino  now it is located in San

Jose  Thank you mayor Arreguin for responding   look forward for your call  and perhaps
meeting with you in person any day next week 

Eid Telephone 510 848 5000

Subject  Eid s TV

Dear Mayor Arreguin 

  moved to Berkeley in 1973 to attend the University of California and I ve been here ever since because  
love this city and wouldn t want to live anywhere else  Eid  who owns Eid s TV opened his electronics
business on North Shattuck around that same time  almost 50 years ago  and he s been in business in
Berkeley ever since 

As you know  Eid s is now located on Telegraph just below Dwight Way  and   understand that the old
arcade that houses his store is going to be demolished and replaced by a modern building  a damned
shame  so Eid is compelled to find another place for his business or close up shop for good if he can t find a
suitable place in central Berkeley to relocate    understand that retail space was found where Eid could
move his store  and the deal was all but consummated when a problem arose 

Eid s is a Berkeley institution and it would be a damned shame if he were driven out of business in his
beloved city because of some capricious reason  Berkeley is changing in many ways to keep up with the
zeitgeist of the 21st century and that is entirely understandable  But if this city gave in to crass
commercialism and took back the hand it had already extended to help a business that s been in Berkeley
for almost 50 years  that would not be the Berkeley   came to know and love and care about 

  entreat you to enable Eid to move his business to the new location that had been previously decided on 
Yours truly 

Jane Phillips

Hello  Eid 

You don t know me but   pass by your store frequently  on my way to and from the dispensary down the
street    also hear you when you call KGO to speak to Pat Thurston  John Rothmann  and the other hosts  
  also hear you when you call Michael Krasny on Forum and Minds Over Matter    always enjoy your calls  

 
you invariably have some very interesting and important things to say    was saddened to hear about the
troubles you re having with your store  It s a shame that the city is going to tear down that unique old
building and force you out  but   was encouraged when the other day you said that another place had been
found where you could move your business  But then you called John s show tonight and said that
someone had blocked the move  even though everybody else had approved it  and you asked people to
contact Jesse Arreguin to protest  so   sent him the email below and   hope the reasons why are evident in
the email 

  sincerely hope that whatever the problem is  it will be surmounted so that you can move your store and
stay in business here in Berkeley as long as you want 

Yours truly 

Jane Phillips
