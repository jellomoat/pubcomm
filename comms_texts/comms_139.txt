Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan  One of the most
important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park    ask for
your full support     

  ask you to change the description of the  alternate design  from just a  partial flow  to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  It can be done while still supporting the
other important park uses and activities  Thank you

 Compassion without anger can become merely sentiment or pity  Knowledge without anger can stagnate into
mere cynicism and apathy  Anger improves lucidity  persistence  audacity  and memory  Jack Newfield  
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
