Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan  One of the most
important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park    ask for
your full support 

I ve lived in Berkeley most of my life  As a child    loved visiting Live Oak Park with its creek  Now   love
visiting Strawberry Creek Park  looking at the creek bouncing over the stones and watching the children
enjoy themselves there  We all need nature for our mental health birds  creeks  trees    would love to
see a fully daylighted creek downtown 

The Civic Center Plan describes the daylighting of the Creek as an  alternate scenario  with just a
 partial restoration    ask that the Plan not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the
 Creek  A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what s possible and would be
more likely to secure funding  Therefore    ask you to change the description of the  alternate plan 
from just a  partial flow  to this   Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek  design and flow

to be determined thru future study 
Thank you

Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
