Dear Mayor and Council 

  have been a supporter of daylighting our creeks for decades  and   urge you to please support a full flow
restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park   

  believe it can be done while still supporting other identified park uses and activities 

Other cities have undertaken creek restoration and daylighting projects and found they greatly enhance the
surrounding areas in ways skeptics assured would never occur 

This project promises to be a wonderful change to our beleaguered downtown
Thank you

Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
