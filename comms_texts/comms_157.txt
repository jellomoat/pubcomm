An underground creek is a dead creek  Please daylight Strawberry Creek 

 Please support a full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  It can be done

RE  Civic Center Plan  July 11 Consent calendar item  33

The Civic Center Plan is excellent and should be accepted with one addendum  the condition of the Strawberry Creek
  culvert has not been sufficiently explored including the options of what to do with this aging infrastructure that runs
under the Maudelle Shirek Building  Old City Hall  There are at least three maps that show its course  and they are
attached  In the Plan  the map is on page 107 

Since Old City Hall was built in 1909  the concrete composing the 9 foot in diameter culvert would be at least that old 
and has already failed in several places  as the City map attached shows  Rebuilding on top of this ancient aqueduct is

unthinkable given the potential for extreme downpours and flooding due to climate change 

No thought has been given in this plan to the options for reinforcing or rerouting the culvert north of the Shirek Building
between it and the public safety building and the costs involved 

Any consideration of a water feature such as partial daylighting of the creek is premature and should wait on the
  recommendations of a study of the culvert s condition and available options

A flow control structure would be  
roquirad in this area for a partial 
flow daylighting scenario
