Dear Mayor Arreguin and City Council Members 

  hope all of you will support the full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in the plans for the new Civic Center Park  It
promises to bring such delight   and wonderful environmental benefits   for all creatures of the natural world  including
people  This will not block or detract from other planned uses at the park 

Thanks so much for all your hard work 
with gratitude
