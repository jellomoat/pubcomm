Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan please give your full
support for the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park 

 ve lived in San Francisco and Berkeley for my whole life and doing a FULL restoration of Strawberry
Creek is an issue I m very passionate about 

  urge you to please advocate changing the description of the daylighting project from its current

phrasing to this   Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek  design and flow to be
determined thru future study 

The way the Civic Center Plan is written to describe the daylighting of the Creek says it is an  alternate
scenario  with just a  partial restoration    request that the Plan not assume any limitations on the
location and flow of the Creek  Please do a full planning and design study for the daylighting  The
above phrasing can help to secure funding 

Thank you 
Chase Hommeyer

  hope all of you will support the full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in the plans for the new Civic Center Park  It
promises to bring such delight   and wonderful environmental benefits   for all creatures of the natural world  including
people  This will not block or detract from other planned uses at the park 

Thanks so much for all your hard work

RE  Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park and Right of way Evaluation and Key
Considerations

Dear Councilmember Harrison 

L understand that a  required  right of way of 150  taken from the 1999 Wolfe
Mason report  is being used to evaluate the potential for daylighting Strawberry
Creek at Civic Center Park  I am concerned that this value if far greater than what
might actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration  so I have
prepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating
the potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park 

The first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert
invert is 18  below the surface  Based on this depth and empirical data of the
Strawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus  we prepared what I
would consider a minimal creek corridor width  I included typical stream bank
treatments such as armored  cut banks  2 1 slopes  small terracing walls  public
access paths  and a small amount of floodplain 

The exercise produced a 76  right of way width  The second drawing was prepared
to show what that 76  width would represent in plan view when placed over Civic
Center Park  Together  these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie
depiction of a restored creek and right of way requirements 

I should add that the right of way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum
width but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to  fit  the restored
channel into the site and accommodate other park uses  It may also be appropriate
to widen the creek right of way in other locations to better integrate the resource
into the broader park program 

I believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language
that emphasizes the need for  full restoration  and that allows for the consideration
of alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site  I hope that these
drawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the
evaluation of more specific design alternatives 

A full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of
Strawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would
conform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design 

 
Drawing A Conceptual Section  Note that this drawing is only partially illustrated 
and a restored creek would have native vegetation on both banks 

CONCEPTUAL SECTION  06 July  2023
STRAWBERRY CREEK   City of Berkeley Restoration Design Group  Inc 

Drawing B  Right of way Diagram illustrating a 76  wide creek corridor  This is for

planning purposes only and does not consider other park and city land uses 
es   7 SUZ ITS 2 RSE eatery


 
Key points 

e Drawing A represents a minimum Right of Way  ROW  necessary to provide
significant ecological services associated with robust riparian ecosystems 

e Drawing B represents   and shows   the minimum ROW required in a plan
view for informational and discussion purposes  but does xof represent a
specific design plan 

  Specific design plans and alternatives would be developed in a fully public 
transparent planning and design process  which would incorporate the
ecological requirements of a restored riparian corridor  as well as the adjacent
conditions related to Civic Center Park  and the input of the community s
many stakeholders 

e The grant program under which California Urban Streams Partnership
 CUSP  has been selected to submit a full grant application  specifically
builds in this public process as part of the grant parameters  Thus  design
and planning alternatives   and the process through which these are
developed   would be funded under this grant  if CUSP and the City were to
receive it 

I hope that this is helpful to the City s planning Process and please don t hesitate to
contact me if you have any questions 

Sincerely

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the

Dear Council 

We at the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum  BHSM  are pleased that the Civic Center
planning has moved along this far  and we want to encourage you to vote to proceed  to the next
phase  It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to
serve its mission  to foster appreciation and understanding of our city s unique history by residents
and visitors alike through research  collection  preservation  exhibition and publication of historical
records  photographs  artifacts and other media   

Although a first floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence  there are
advantages to the current plan  which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall
space for exhibits on the other levels  We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take
place first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut
down  We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes  furnishings and
 equipment for BHSM spaces 

As you may know  the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with
Berkeley s centennial   There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City
Hall and the Acheson Building  and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City
Hall  We are now approaching the Society s 50th anniversary and the city s sesquicentennial in
2028  Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building  It is thirty years
this month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993  and it seems the building has received
minimal maintenance by the City since then  The main floor is overheated in the winter  the second
floor has no heat  and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition 

The Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained  for example  peeling paint on its exterior
woodwork will cause further damage  While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and
renovations to take place at some point in the future  we hope the City staff can find a way to attend
to some of these two buildings  sore needs in the meantime 

For several years we have been sending each of you our   quarterly newsletter containing articles  
about Berkeley history   If you would like it to go to your home address  please let me know  We
hope you have been able to read at least some issues and visit some of our exhibits and events  We
also encourage you to explore our new website  berkhistory org 

  We look forward to working in partnership with the City and the Community for a Cultural Civic Center
on bringing an exciting new vision for ine Civic Center complex into reality  Please feel free to contact
me if you have any questions 

 
Sincerely 
Ann Harlow

President  Berkeley Historical Society and Museum  on behalf of its Board of Directors

remember what a tremendous impact occurred when a waterfall park was built in mid Manhattan  While not  yet  a

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council Members 

_ On July 11 please support the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park in the Civic Center Plan 

The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an  alternate scenario  using
the term  partial flow creek bed  The proposed Design for the creek should not assume any limitations on
the location and flow of the creek  A full planning and design study would give the Council a better sense of
what s possible and would be more likely to secure funding 

Therefore  please change the description of the  alternate design  from just a  partial flow  to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  This can be done while still supporting the
other important park uses and activities

RE  Civic Center Plan  July 11 Consent calendar item  33

The Civic Center Plan is excellent and should be accepted with one addendum  the condition of the Strawberry Creek
  culvert has not been sufficiently explored including the options of what to do with this aging infrastructure that runs
under the Maudelle Shirek Building  Old City Hall  There are at least three maps that show its course  and they are
attached  In the Plan  the map is on page 107 

Since Old City Hall was built in 1909  the concrete composing the 9 foot in diameter culvert would be at least that old 
and has already failed in several places  as the City map attached shows  Rebuilding on top of this ancient aqueduct is

unthinkable given the potential for extreme downpours and flooding due to climate change 

No thought has been given in this plan to the options for reinforcing or rerouting the culvert north of the Shirek Building
between it and the public safety building and the costs involved 

Any consideration of a water feature such as partial daylighting of the creek is premature and should wait on the
  recommendations of a study of the culvert s condition and available options

enjoy themselves there  We all need nature for our mental health birds  creeks  trees    would love to
see a fully daylighted creek downtown 

The Civic Center Plan describes the daylighting of the Creek as an  alternate scenario  with just a
 partial restoration    ask that the Plan not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the
 Creek  A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what s possible and would be
more likely to secure funding  Therefore    ask you to change the description of the  alternate plan 
from just a  partial flow  to this   Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek  design and flow

to be determined thru future study 
Thank you

Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.

Regarding  Berkeley Civic Center Planning

Members of the City Council 

The Landmarks Preservation Commission has watched with interest  periodic
participation  and encouragement the lengthy planning process for renovation of
Berkeley s Civic Center  By and large  from a preservation standpoint  the process has 
worked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to
historic issues  We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on
next steps  The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically 

1 

Calls for and supports  as a general principle  the restoration  refurbishment  and
sensitive adaptive re use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and
the park  rather than their radical replacement  demolition  or alteration 

supports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives
connected to the Civic Center  including the LPC  Civic Arts  Parks   Waterfront 
Disability  and Transportation   Public Works  The ongoing subcommittee has been 
and should remain  a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues 
interact with staff  consultants  and the public  and advise the Council on planning
proposals and projects for the Civic Center  The subcommittee can particularly serve
as a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024 2027  research  schematic
design and approvals funding plan  design development  phase 

supports  and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with
further planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek
Building and the Veterans Building  particularly funding for seismic
strengthening  There should be no substantial pause in planning  These are highly
important structures that are both historic and useful  and the City should make it a
high priority to bring both of them back into full use  Both buildings are currently living
on borrowed time  given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the
Bay Area

  supports full accessibility for the buildings  with a design approach that also
minimizes impacts   alterations to the main facades  If the zig zag ramp on the
front of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned   modified or replaced use of the
State Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to
better harmonize with the historic front steps   facade 

  supports recommendations of the consultant   staff reports that emphasize  
restoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings  both inside and out 
including original finishes  details  and maintaining general historic interior
layout  The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through
adaptive design  as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors 
Use of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent
possible   

  supports  in concept  the addition of infill structures placed behind the two
buildings to expand their useable square footage  Additions should be
designed and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior s Standards and
do not detract from  compete with  or alter the principal facades of the historic
buildings 

  supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to
one or both courtyards of the Veterans Building  Courtyard infill would
considerably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a
large number of simultaneous arts events and activities  and is also best
constructed in conjunction with overall building renovations  The courtyards are
near ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have
an impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building 

  supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck   event space to the roof
_ of the Veterans Building  so long as it is designed in such a way that it is
concealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic
facade  especially when seen from across the park 

  supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses  including
performing arts and visual arts  Supports the broadest possible access of arts
and community groups to the building  rather than exclusive or extensive use of
the building for   by a small number of groups   organizations

hall  for City and civic meeting and educational use  including maximizing the
provision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes  so
several meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building 
and so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual
and in person participation 

  supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley

Community Media and the Berkeley Historical Society   Museum  BHSM 
Both uses are compatible with the history   use of the building  Berkeley
Community Media also provides support for civic meetings  such as broadcast of
Council and Commission meetings  while BHSM s proposed operation of a
museum and history research center would bring users to the building 

supports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city
programs interested in local history  such as the History Room in the Public
Library  to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a  one stop  center
of local historical education  research  display  and archives 

supports  in particular  the preservation and re use of specific key historic
spaces in both buildings including  within the Veterans Building  the fine
auditorium  and four lodge   meeting rooms  and extensive lobby  within the
Maudelle Shirek Building  the interior halls and grand staircase  and the
historic Council Chambers on the upper floor  the Council Chamber room is
currently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as  
Commissions that expect a considerable audience 

supports the creation of a new  large  multipurpose room addition to the rear of
the Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large
Commission meetings  as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use
and activities  The room should be designed flexibly without fixed   built in seating
or furniture  so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses 

encourages consideration of moving Berkeley s Visitor Center to the Shirek
Building to bring more users  tourists  and visitors to the Civic Center

encourages providing both buildings with  catering kitchens  and support
infrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and
rental events such as receptions  social gatherings  and even meals   dinner events 

calls for  and supports creation of  a comprehensive interpretive signage and
website program that would educate the public about the history and
development of the Civic Center   

opposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from
elsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building  This
would do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses   users 
and would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active
uses  In addition  an approach that emphasizes  more city staff offices  will simply
not resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to
future Civic Center renovations  discourages any pre reservation or design of space
in the buildings for programs that do not currently exist 

notes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local
veterans organizations  which were large and active at the time it was built 
Permanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a
means for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have
ongoing and affordable access to meeting   event space in the Civic Center 

encourages the City to plan  renovate  and manage the Civic Center buildings
so they can be rented when not in civic uses such as public meetings or
community arts events for uses  both small and large  from concerts  festivals 
and fairs to meetings  conventions  and conferences  If effectively designed and
managed the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to
hold conferences and events  while also producing income for the City 

  encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so

the Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus  which is the
largest indoor theater space in Berkeley  can be restored and integrated into
Civic Center activities and use 

generally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green
spaces and existing trees  provides unobtrusive infrastructure  bathrooms  power

sources  lighting  etc  to support multiple uses  emphasizes not only event use  but
supports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users  reuses
rather than unnecessarily demolishes  existing hardscape  emphasizes the park as a
harmonious  historic  and generally symmetrical civic space  and brings water back
to the fountain  discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that
unnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future
functionality   

23 Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non historic parking lot
behind 2180 Milvia  at the east end of the park  and supports integration of this
area into the park space overall  A portion of this area could  as plans currently
propose  remain hardscape  not for daily parking  but for use as a Staging area for
larger events within the park 

24 supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large
gatherings  festivals  and similar events  Opposes construction of new
permanent structures  particularly buildings  in the park space  and encourages
event facilities to be designed unobtrusively  for example  it should be planned and
possible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park  but building big
outdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses  
users  The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages 

25  Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center
 including memorial trees  and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the
buildings  be fully identified  maintained  and protected  particularly memorials
to veterans  Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained 

26  Reserves judgment on the possibility of  daylighting  Strawberry Creek within
the Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted 
The LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies   proposals for
daylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential
impact on the historic design and character of the park in particular  The LPC
encourages all  including the City and private groups  studying daylighting to
take into account two key issues  preserving the overall physical framework  
historic character   design of the Civic Center  ensuring ample and adequate access
for the public  especially for disabled t users  to the buildings and outdoor spaces of
the Civic Center
