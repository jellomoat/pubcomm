Dear Mayor  Council Member 

  recommend that you 

Adopt a Resolution opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company  TEPCO  and the
government of Japan s plan to discharge wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean and send copies of this resolution to Secretary
Blinken  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Alex Padilla  and Representative Barbara Lee 
Am attaching a 3 page letter to you from Seaver Wang  PhD  Earth and Ocean Sciences Co

To  Honaratile Mayor and Members of the City Council  
From  Dr  Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute

Subject  We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison s Symbolic and Non Scientific Proposed Resolution
Criticizing the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant 

Any visitor walking along Berkeley s sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after
house  in window after window   In this house we believe science is real  with Berkeley hosting one of the
nation s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory  this communal respect for the
scientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody 

As such  we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new
resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan s planned discharge of objectively
harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant 

Councilmember Harrison s resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated
water from the Fukushima facility  If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly
from the planned Fukushima releases  following desalination  for a full year at the planned upper limit
concentration of 40 500 picocuries liter  1500 bequerels L  their total added dose of radiation would be
0 0197 millisieverts  Sv  the equivalent of less than one fifth the dose of a medical chest X ray  0 1 mSv 
and approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5 hour coast to coast airline flight  0 02
mSv  The planned Fukushima release is already around just one seventh of the World Health
Organization s threshold for tritium in drinking water

Dilution of the Fukushima release by a little over a factor of two would put the release well below the U S 
Environmental Protection Agency s threshold for tritium in water of 20 000 pCi L  Needless to say  the vast
Pacific Ocean is approximately 700 000 000 000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at
Fukushima  which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades  Scientific
measurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally occuring
background radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release  In their final report
reviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant  the International Atomic Energy  
Agency determined that the planned release will  have a negligible radiological impact  and is  consistent
with relevant international safety standards  My colleagues and Tat the Breakthrough Institute would be
happy to drink the treated water  if provided  at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that
the water is entirely safe 

By the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California  a oceanic circulation
process requiring around 2 3 years  no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any
remaining additional radioactivity from the release  Clearly  Councilmember Kate Harrison s claim that the
release  could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region  and  imposes considerable 
risks to environmental and human rights across the globe  amounts to nothing but sheer political theater 
The risk to Berkeley  residents and businesses  is  quite literally  zero 

We further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to
quote represent explicitly anti nuclear advocacy groups  including Greenpeace International  Friends of the
Earth  and No Nukes Action  These single mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained
ideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against
climate change  Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize
nuclear energy  Councilmember Harrison s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically
rigorous and open minded researchers  more forward thinking advocates  and institutions that support
clean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind  solar  batteries  and other low carbon energy sources
in decarbonizing the global energy system   

In response to Councilmember Harrison s invocation of social justice  we assert that anti nuclear
misinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese  Asian  and Pacific

peoples because of the exaggerated discourse on the Fukushima water release issue  Anti nuclear activists 
 playing to radiation related historical traumas and vastly inflating the public health and environmental
risks posed by the release  have inflicted arid continue to inflict undue anxiety upon communities across
the Asia Pacific  while threatening economic harm to the peoples of Fukushima  Miyagi  and Ibaraki
Prefectures in Japan  These organizations would celebrate the shutdown of nuclear power stations across
Asia  even if this prolongs the continued operation of fossil fuel power plants that contribute to climate
change and would directly sicken more Japanese  Korean  or Taiwanese people from air pollution 

We strongly urge the other members of the Berkeley City Council to reject Councilmember Harrison s empty
resolution in the most forceful terms  And we rebuke Councilmember Harrison for occupying the city s
public agenda with a resolution that is at best political grandstanding  and at worst environmentally
counterproductive and harmful to social justice

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
