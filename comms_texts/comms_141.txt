RE  Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park and Right of way Evaluation and Key
Considerations

Dear Councilmember Harrison 

L understand that a  required  right of way of 150  taken from the 1999 Wolfe
Mason report  is being used to evaluate the potential for daylighting Strawberry
Creek at Civic Center Park  I am concerned that this value if far greater than what
might actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration  so I have
prepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating
the potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park 

The first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert
invert is 18  below the surface  Based on this depth and empirical data of the
Strawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus  we prepared what I
would consider a minimal creek corridor width  I included typical stream bank
treatments such as armored  cut banks  2 1 slopes  small terracing walls  public
access paths  and a small amount of floodplain 

The exercise produced a 76  right of way width  The second drawing was prepared
to show what that 76  width would represent in plan view when placed over Civic
Center Park  Together  these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie
depiction of a restored creek and right of way requirements 

I should add that the right of way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum
width but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to  fit  the restored
channel into the site and accommodate other park uses  It may also be appropriate
to widen the creek right of way in other locations to better integrate the resource
into the broader park program 

I believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language
that emphasizes the need for  full restoration  and that allows for the consideration
of alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site  I hope that these
drawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the
evaluation of more specific design alternatives 

A full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of
Strawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would
conform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design

Key points 

e Drawing A represents a minimum Right of Way  ROW  necessary to provide
significant ecological services associated with robust riparian ecosystems 

e Drawing B represents   and shows   the minimum ROW required in a plan
view for informational and discussion purposes  but does xof represent a
specific design plan 

  Specific design plans and alternatives would be developed in a fully public 
transparent planning and design process  which would incorporate the
ecological requirements of a restored riparian corridor  as well as the adjacent
conditions related to Civic Center Park  and the input of the community s
many stakeholders 

e The grant program under which California Urban Streams Partnership
 CUSP  has been selected to submit a full grant application  specifically
builds in this public process as part of the grant parameters  Thus  design
and planning alternatives   and the process through which these are
developed   would be funded under this grant  if CUSP and the City were to
receive it 

I hope that this is helpful to the City s planning Process and please don t hesitate to
contact me if you have any questions 

Sincerely 

  Drew Goetting
Principal
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
