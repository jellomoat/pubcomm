Regarding  Berkeley Civic Center Planning

Members of the City Council 

The Landmarks Preservation Commission has watched with interest  periodic
participation  and encouragement the lengthy planning process for renovation of
Berkeley s Civic Center  By and large  from a preservation standpoint  the process has 
worked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to
historic issues  We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on
next steps  The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically 

1 

Calls for and supports  as a general principle  the restoration  refurbishment  and
sensitive adaptive re use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and
the park  rather than their radical replacement  demolition  or alteration 

supports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives
connected to the Civic Center  including the LPC  Civic Arts  Parks   Waterfront 
Disability  and Transportation   Public Works  The ongoing subcommittee has been 
and should remain  a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues 
interact with staff  consultants  and the public  and advise the Council on planning
proposals and projects for the Civic Center  The subcommittee can particularly serve
as a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024 2027  research  schematic
design and approvals funding plan  design development  phase 

supports  and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with
further planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek
Building and the Veterans Building  particularly funding for seismic
strengthening  There should be no substantial pause in planning  These are highly
important structures that are both historic and useful  and the City should make it a
high priority to bring both of them back into full use  Both buildings are currently living
on borrowed time  given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the
Bay Area

  supports full accessibility for the buildings  with a design approach that also
minimizes impacts   alterations to the main facades  If the zig zag ramp on the
front of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned   modified or replaced use of the
State Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to
better harmonize with the historic front steps   facade 

  supports recommendations of the consultant   staff reports that emphasize  
restoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings  both inside and out 
including original finishes  details  and maintaining general historic interior
layout  The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through
adaptive design  as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors 
Use of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent
possible   

  supports  in concept  the addition of infill structures placed behind the two
buildings to expand their useable square footage  Additions should be
designed and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior s Standards and
do not detract from  compete with  or alter the principal facades of the historic
buildings 

  supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to
one or both courtyards of the Veterans Building  Courtyard infill would
considerably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a
large number of simultaneous arts events and activities  and is also best
constructed in conjunction with overall building renovations  The courtyards are
near ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have
an impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building 

  supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck   event space to the roof
_ of the Veterans Building  so long as it is designed in such a way that it is
concealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic
facade  especially when seen from across the park 

  supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses  including
performing arts and visual arts  Supports the broadest possible access of arts
and community groups to the building  rather than exclusive or extensive use of
the building for   by a small number of groups   organizations

hall  for City and civic meeting and educational use  including maximizing the
provision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes  so
several meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building 
and so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual
and in person participation 

  supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley

Community Media and the Berkeley Historical Society   Museum  BHSM 
Both uses are compatible with the history   use of the building  Berkeley
Community Media also provides support for civic meetings  such as broadcast of
Council and Commission meetings  while BHSM s proposed operation of a
museum and history research center would bring users to the building 

supports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city
programs interested in local history  such as the History Room in the Public
Library  to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a  one stop  center
of local historical education  research  display  and archives 

supports  in particular  the preservation and re use of specific key historic
spaces in both buildings including  within the Veterans Building  the fine
auditorium  and four lodge   meeting rooms  and extensive lobby  within the
Maudelle Shirek Building  the interior halls and grand staircase  and the
historic Council Chambers on the upper floor  the Council Chamber room is
currently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as  
Commissions that expect a considerable audience 

supports the creation of a new  large  multipurpose room addition to the rear of
the Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large
Commission meetings  as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use
and activities  The room should be designed flexibly without fixed   built in seating
or furniture  so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses 

encourages consideration of moving Berkeley s Visitor Center to the Shirek
Building to bring more users  tourists  and visitors to the Civic Center

encourages providing both buildings with  catering kitchens  and support
infrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and
rental events such as receptions  social gatherings  and even meals   dinner events 

calls for  and supports creation of  a comprehensive interpretive signage and
website program that would educate the public about the history and
development of the Civic Center   

opposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from
elsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building  This
would do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses   users 
and would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active
uses  In addition  an approach that emphasizes  more city staff offices  will simply
not resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to
future Civic Center renovations  discourages any pre reservation or design of space
in the buildings for programs that do not currently exist 

notes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local
veterans organizations  which were large and active at the time it was built 
Permanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a
means for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have
ongoing and affordable access to meeting   event space in the Civic Center 

encourages the City to plan  renovate  and manage the Civic Center buildings
so they can be rented when not in civic uses such as public meetings or
community arts events for uses  both small and large  from concerts  festivals 
and fairs to meetings  conventions  and conferences  If effectively designed and
managed the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to
hold conferences and events  while also producing income for the City 

  encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so

the Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus  which is the
largest indoor theater space in Berkeley  can be restored and integrated into
Civic Center activities and use 

generally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green
spaces and existing trees  provides unobtrusive infrastructure  bathrooms  power

sources  lighting  etc  to support multiple uses  emphasizes not only event use  but
supports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users  reuses
rather than unnecessarily demolishes  existing hardscape  emphasizes the park as a
harmonious  historic  and generally symmetrical civic space  and brings water back
to the fountain  discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that
unnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future
functionality   

23 Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non historic parking lot
behind 2180 Milvia  at the east end of the park  and supports integration of this
area into the park space overall  A portion of this area could  as plans currently
propose  remain hardscape  not for daily parking  but for use as a Staging area for
larger events within the park 

24 supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large
gatherings  festivals  and similar events  Opposes construction of new
permanent structures  particularly buildings  in the park space  and encourages
event facilities to be designed unobtrusively  for example  it should be planned and
possible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park  but building big
outdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses  
users  The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages 

25  Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center
 including memorial trees  and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the
buildings  be fully identified  maintained  and protected  particularly memorials
to veterans  Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained 

26  Reserves judgment on the possibility of  daylighting  Strawberry Creek within
the Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted 
The LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies   proposals for
daylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential
impact on the historic design and character of the park in particular  The LPC
encourages all  including the City and private groups  studying daylighting to
take into account two key issues  preserving the overall physical framework  
historic character   design of the Civic Center  ensuring ample and adequate access
for the public  especially for disabled t users  to the buildings and outdoor spaces of
the Civic Center
