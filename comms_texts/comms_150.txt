Subject  Item 33   Restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe 

  urge the Council to support the daylighting of Strawberry Creek as part of the Civic Center Park design  The city s

growing forest of tall buildings most without setback make humanizing the downtown even more important   

remember what a tremendous impact occurred when a waterfall park was built in mid Manhattan  While not  yet  a

Manhattan  Berkeley needs to do all it can to make the downtown a place people will want to visit  The sound of water

attracts people as well much as birds
