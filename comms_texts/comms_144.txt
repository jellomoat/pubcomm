Dear Mayor and Berkeley City Council 

Please support a full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  It can be done
while still supporting other identified park uses and activities 

Thank you 
Sylvia Soriano
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
