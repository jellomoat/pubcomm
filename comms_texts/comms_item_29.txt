To Whom It May Concern 

lam Seaver Wang  Co Director of the Climate and Energy team at the Breakthrough Institute  a US based environmental

nonprofit research center located in Berkeley  California  It has recently come to our attention that Berkeley City
Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose

Japan s planned discharge of objectively harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant 

As a Berkeley based environmental research institution with staff possessing special expertise in oceanography and
nuclear power plant safety  we find this proposed resolution to be a senseless distraction for the city s public agenda
that is at best political grandstanding  and at worst environmentally counterproductive and harmful to social justice 

As we establish in our attached letter  the proposed release of water poses zero risk to public health and environmental
safety off the coast of Japan  and certainly for Berkeley residents and businesses  We show that a person drinking
nothing but the treated water for an entire year would experience a fraction of the equivalent of a chest X ray
procedure  We emphasize that the International Atomic Energy Agency has determined in their final report  released
this week  that the planned release will  have a negligible radiological impact  and is  consistent with relevant
international safety standards 

We have attached our comment on Councilmember Harrison s proposed resolution to this email as a PDF document   

Yours sincerely

To  Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council
From  Dr  Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute

Subject  We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison s Symbolic and Non Scientific Proposed Resolution
Criticizing the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant 

Any visitor walking along Berkeley s sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after
house  in window after window   In this house we believe science is real  With Berkeley hosting one of the
nation s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory  this communal respect for the
scientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody 

As such  we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new
resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan s planned discharge of objectively
harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant 

Councilmember Harrison s resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated
water from the Fukushima facility  If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly
from the planned Fukushima releases  following desalination  fora full year at the planned upper limit
concentration of 40 500 picocuries liter  1500 bequerels L  their total added dose of radiation would be
0 0197 millisieverts  Sv  the equivalent of less than one fifth the dose of a medical chest X ray  0 1 mSv 
and approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5 hour coast to coast airline flight  0 02
mSv  The planned Fukushima release is already around just one seventh of the World Health
Organization s threshold for tritium in drinking water

Dilution of the Fukushima release by a little over a factor of two would put the release well below the U S 
Environmental Protection Agency s threshold for tritium in water of 20 000 pCi L  Needless to say  the vast
Pacific Ocean is approximately 700 000 000 000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at
Fukushima  which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades  Scientific
measurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally occuring
background radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release  In their final report
reviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant  the International Atomic Energy

_ Agency determined that the planned release will  have a negligible radiological impact  and is  consistent
with relevant international safety standards  My colleagues and I at the Breakthrough Institute would be
happy to drink the treated water  if provided  at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that
the water is entirely safe   

By the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California  a oceanic circulation
process requiring around 2 3 years  no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any
remaining additional radioactivity from the release  Clearly  Councilmember Kate Harrison s claim that the
release  could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region  and  imposes considerable
risks to environmental and human rights across the globe  amounts to nothing but sheer political theater 
The risk to Berkeley  residents and businesses  is  quite literally  zero 

We further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to
quote represent explicitly anti nuclear advocacy groups  including Greenpeace International  Friends of the
Earth  and No Nukes Action  These single mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained  
ideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against
climate change  Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize
nuclear energy  Councilmember Harrison s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically
rigorous and open minded researchers  more forward thinking advocates  and institutions that support
clean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind  solar  batteries  and other low carbon energy sources
in decarbonizing the global energy system 

_ In response to Councilmember Harrison s invocation of social justice  we assert that anti nuclear
misinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese  Asian  and Pacific

peoples because of the exaggerated discourse on the Fukushima water release issue  Anti nuclear activists 
playing to radiation related historical traumas and vastly inflating the public health and environmental
risks posed by the release  have inflicted and continue to inflict undue anxiety upon communities across
the Asia Pacific  while threatening economic harm to the peoples of Fukushima  Miyagi  and Ibaraki
Prefectures in Japan  These organizations would celebrate the shutdown of nuclear power stations across
Asia  even if this prolongs the continued operation of fossil fuel power plants that contribute to climate

change and would directly sicken more Japanese  Korean  or Taiwanese people from air pollution 

We strongly urge the other members of the Berkeley City Council to reject Councilmember Harrison s empty
resolution in the most forceful terms  And we rebuke Councilmember Harrison for occupying the city s
public agenda with a resolution that is at best political grandstanding  and at worst environmentally
counterproductive and harmful to social justice

Subject  Yes to Consent Item  29   Oppose Discharge of Wamewater from Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Oceam

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or r attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe 
Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council   

  am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley  to
urge you to adopt by consent the Resolution  Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the
Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into
the Pacific Ocean  Consent Item  29  at tomorrow s Council meeting 

The government of Japan and TEPCO  Tokyo Electric Power Company  plan to soon begin dumping 1 3
million tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean  Currents will bring it here and 
eventually  around the world  A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from
Fukushima across the Pacific to California  Moreover  traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off
the coast of California since 2015  70  of the water supposedly  treated  with the ALPS  Advanced Liquid
Processing System  which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for
discharge  Strontium 90  one of the radionuclides found in the  treated  water  is among the most hazardous
radionuclides  once in the body  Strontium 90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and
teeth  where it can cause the cancers of bone  bone marrow  and soft tissues around the bone  TEPCO s
 safety  claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT  Organically Bound Tritium  on a
human body  once it enters the body  OBT can replace water in soft tissues  causing damage to DNA and cell
mutations  Because of TEPCO s inadequate sampling practices  lack of data on what the water actually
contains  and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues  bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the
discharge  experts like Robert H  Richmond  director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa  are calling the plan  ill advised  and premature 

The people   of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea  China  the Philippines  as well as the Pacific  
Island nations  overwhelmingly oppose the dumping  The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of
international  independent  interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the
best solution  which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and  therefore  will have very
little contact with humans  While it may not be the perfect solution  the cement encasement is far safer than
dumping it in the ocean  the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released 

The IAEA  International Atomic Energy Agency  which has approved the plan  has a contradictory dual
purpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time  For this
reason  the IAEA is often seen as biased  An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower
suggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from
the final report at the request of the Japanese government 

it is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future  
generations    urge you to vote in support of the resolution  Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company  
and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power

  Plant into the Pacific Ocean  at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th  on behalf of concerned
citizens like myself 

 
Thank you to Council Member Harrison for being the author on the consent item 
Sincerely 
Miya Sommers
