Subject    Full Flow Restoration of Strawberry Creek

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe 
  have contacted my City Council multiple times to fully support the restoration of Strawberry Creek and all
water flowing from the Berkeley Hills to the Bay  Clean water being filtered by sunlight will make humans  fish
and other wildlife migrating down the corridors healthier and  hopefully  happier  Full flow restoration makes _
sense  Do this work completely and well 

Thank you
