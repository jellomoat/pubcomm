Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan 

One of the most important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center
Park  This decisive move will bring more of the natural elements into the park  none so delightful as
water  Also it will increase the biodiversity of the environs and lend an additional educational feature

to the whole park 

  Please change the description of the  alternate design  from just a  partial flow  to a full flow
restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park 

  ask for your full support 

Thank you 
  Summer Brenner
DISTRICT 4
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
