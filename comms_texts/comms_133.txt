Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Oceam

Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council   

  am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley  to
urge you to adopt by consent the Resolution  Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the
Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into
the Pacific Ocean  Consent Item  29  at tomorrow s Council meeting 

The government of Japan and TEPCO  Tokyo Electric Power Company  plan to soon begin dumping 1 3
million tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean  Currents will bring it here and 
eventually  around the world  A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from
Fukushima across the Pacific to California  Moreover  traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off
the coast of California since 2015  70  of the water supposedly  treated  with the ALPS  Advanced Liquid
Processing System  which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for
discharge  Strontium 90  one of the radionuclides found in the  treated  water  is among the most hazardous
radionuclides  once in the body  Strontium 90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and
teeth  where it can cause the cancers of bone  bone marrow  and soft tissues around the bone  TEPCO s
 safety  claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT  Organically Bound Tritium  on a
human body  once it enters the body  OBT can replace water in soft tissues  causing damage to DNA and cell
mutations  Because of TEPCO s inadequate sampling practices  lack of data on what the water actually
contains  and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues  bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the
discharge  experts like Robert H  Richmond  director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa  are calling the plan  ill advised  and premature 

The people   of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea  China  the Philippines  as well as the Pacific  
Island nations  overwhelmingly oppose the dumping  The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of
international  independent  interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the
best solution  which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and  therefore  will have very
little contact with humans  While it may not be the perfect solution  the cement encasement is far safer than
dumping it in the ocean  the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released 

The IAEA  International Atomic Energy Agency  which has approved the plan  has a contradictory dual
purpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time  For this
reason  the IAEA is often seen as biased  An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower
suggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from
the final report at the request of the Japanese government 

it is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future  
generations    urge you to vote in support of the resolution  Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company  
and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power

  Plant into the Pacific Ocean  at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th  on behalf of concerned
citizens like myself 

 
Thank you to Council Member Harrison for being the author on the consent item 
Sincerely 
Miya Sommers
