Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council 

We urge you to adopt the Resolution on consent tomorrow night towards stopping the dangerous release of 1 3  
million tons  and counting  of radioactive water from Fukushima into the Pacific  The dangers are proven by hard  
science  but you need not read the peer reviewed studies and the pleas from the Pacific Island Forum s
independent  international team of scientists  from the government of Korea  etc  It is common sense that releasing
that huge amount of nuclear waste water into the ocean  on top of other releases  cannot be in the interest of public  
health or the Pacific flora fauna  Keeping it on site is best  and using it to make concrete as recommended by the
interdisciplinary experts mentioned above 

As you know  the nuclear industry is extremely powerful and hires skilled marketing professionals  as well as funding
biased  think tanks  to maximize profits  Do not be confused by the Breakthrough Institute s profit driven

_ misstatements of fact  Even the  AEA has been bought out  with promoting nuclear energy being the major part of
its mission 

If you have any reservations  about passing the Resolution by consent  please be sure to read this

  honor the original inhabitants  the documented 5 000 year history of a
vibrant community at the West Berkeley Shellmound  the Ohlone people who reside here and beyond  and
all ancestors and descendants of slavery and attempted genocide  Colonists  descendants still benefit from the
occupation of stolen lands and other exploitation  The U S s tragic history is heart breaking and shameful 
Rematriation and extensive reparations are long overdue 
Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
