Dear Berkeley City Council 

I m grateful to you for hearing the matter to decriminalize  deprioritize  entheogenic plants and
fungi   am a former English instructor at Berkeley City College  2001 2011  an Oakland Pen
 award winning poet and filmmaker who resides here in Berkeley    am also a member of
Psychedelics in Recovery  a 12 step based fellowship whose members use psychedelics in their
personal work to recover from maladaptive behaviors  such as addiction    am also a member in
good standing of Sacred Garden Community Church  an entheogenic church based in Oakland  CA 

  am asking for your support for this resolution on entheogenic plants and fungi  and for removal
of restrictions on sharing in the second resolved statement  In my church the sharing of  
sacraments is a sacred act  equivalent of the sharing of the Host in Christian churches  or the
sharing of the Seder plate in Judaism  This second resolved statement will complicate  if not
prohibit  that practice and infringe on our rights to practice our faith in the full freedom granted
to us under our Constitution    therefore plead with you to remove that clause to allow our
members to practice their faith without undue complications   

Thank you for considering the decriminalization of these sacred plants and removing restrictions
on their use  Hundreds of thousands  and historically  millions  have found healing with these
sacred medicines  and your courage in allowing people to work with these plants as they feel need
will add to the growing movement to bring this unspeakably inhumane  infantilizing and  
destructive  even criminal   War on Drugs  under which the country has suffered for far too long 

Sincerely 
Clifton Ross
