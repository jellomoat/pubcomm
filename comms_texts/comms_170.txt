Dear Councilwoman Harrison  Mr  Mayor and Berkeley City Council 

As a Berkeley resident and director of an ocean health non profit  Shark Stewards a project of The Earth Island Institute 
we support your resolution to oppose the Tokyo Electric Power Company proposal to release contaminated wastewater  
form Fukushima   

Despite opposition of The Pacific lsland Forum scientists  Japanese citizens and neighboring governments  the Tokyo
Electric Power Company  TEPCO  intends to move ahead in discharging thousands of tons of radioactive wastewater into  
the ocean in coming weeks 

Along with other citizens and non protits ss we are sharing our voice on behalf of the ocean and ocean health eppeenip this
release 

In care and protection of our ocean  South Korea  other Pacific Islands nations  hundreds of institutions  global NGOs  and
thousands of fishers have ail risen to the responsibility of creating educational awareness  alternative solutions  and
political resolutions to this pivotal decision  as this precedent setting event approaches over the horizon 

We encourage you to reject the letter sent by industry advocate Breakthru Institute with their specious argument lumping
ocean non profits as No Nuke groups  and obfuscating risk of exposure 

We are representing public and environmental health interests  and Tesco s  dilution and dumping solution  instead of
available treatment technologies 

Although currents may take 3 or more years to reach us  migratory marine megafauna such as bluefin tuna take less than
a year 

Untreated Beta emitting molecules such as tritium pose an internal exposure risk to vertebrates  and potentially impact
more than human health  but also coral reefs and Pacific marine life 

Breakthru s statement that  The risk to Berkeley  residents and businesses  is  quite literally  zero  is in direct conflict

with the City of Berkeley s global championship of the rights of people and the environment  By adopting the proposed
resolution  the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship  
and justice and send a  powerful message to decision makers at all levels 

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter    trust that you will consider the scientific evidence  environmental

implications  and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote 
Please feel free to contact me if there is any additional information or support   can provide

Subject  Urgent Support Needed  Resolution Opposing Fukushima Wastewater Discharge

WARNING  This is not a City of Berkeley email  Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is

Dear Jesse Arreguin  Kate Harrison  Rashi Kesarwani  Terry Taplin  Ben Bartlett  Sophie Hahn  Susan Wengraf 

Rigel Robinson and Mark Humbert 

  hope this email finds you well    am writing to express my strong support for Councilmember Kate Harrison s decision
to include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of
Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on tomorrow s agenda at the
California Berkeley City Council   

As a concerned citizen who respects and honors representatives sensitive to the needs of our planet  we must act in
solidarity with our friends in this crucial matter  Recently  Tokyo Electric Power Company announced its intention to
move forward with discharging radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks  This development has
prompted various groups worldwide to unite and voice their concerns regarding the protection of our oceans 

In caring for and safeguarding our marine ecosystems  countries like Korea  Pacific Islands nations  numerous
institutions  global NGOs  and thousands of fishers have assumed the responsibility of creating educational awareness 
exploring alternative solutions  and seeking political resolutions  It is against this backdrop that the California Berkeley
City Council will be voting on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan s
Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean 

  urge you to attentively listen to the stories  data  and experiences shared during the Council meeting  as they may
shape a better future for our oceans  The Ocean Health Cooperative  among other organizations  will present valuable
information that can contribute to informed decision making 

In light of the gravity of the situation    recommend that the California Berkeley City Council adopts the Resolution
opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company  TEPCO  and the government of Japan s plan to discharge wastewater from the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean  Furthermore    suggest that copies of this resolution be
sent to Secretary Blinken  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Alex Padilla  and Representative Barbara Lee  in order to
raise awareness and garner support at the federal level 

It is crucial to consider the background surrounding this issue  Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima disaster
reached California s shores in 2015  and on April 13  2021  the government of Japan announced TEPCO s plan to release
additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as soon as Spring of 2023  This proposed discharge raises alarming
concerns about the health of our planet and the well being of future generations  Insufficient due diligence has been
conducted to ensure the safety of this action  and numerous experts have argued that TEPCO and the government of
Japan are proceeding without a proper understanding of the potential risks involved 

While TEPCO and the government of Japan assert that the wastewater has been treated and poses no environmental or
health risks  scientific evidence contradicts their claims  Many marine biologists  marine pollution experts  and scientists
have highlighted significant shortcomings in the due diligence process  particularly regarding the  Advanced Liquid
Processing System   ALPS  the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site  This system is incapable of removing all
radioactive materials before the release 

 
Furthermore  in April 2021  three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights
Council expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives
and livelihoods in the Pacific region  They emphasized the considerable risks posed to environmental and human rights
globally 

It is important to note that on March 6  2023  the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the

_ government of Japan s planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  By joining the
City of West Hollywood and tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide  the City of Berkeley can reaffirm its
position as a global environmental leader  committed to protecting our planet s natural resources 

In conclusion    implore you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison s initiative and take a stand against the planned
discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean  By adopting the
proposed resolution  the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental
stewardship and send a powerful message to decision makers at all levels 

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter    trust that you will consider the scientific evidence  environmental
implications  and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote  Please let me know if there is any
additional information or support   can provide 

Yours sincerely

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
