I m a Berkeley resident    want to live in a place that has more than Just dense housing  Please vote to daylight

Strawberry Creek at its full flow 

It is the right thing to do to give us back a natural feature that supports other life 

Thank you  Carolyn Shoulders
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
