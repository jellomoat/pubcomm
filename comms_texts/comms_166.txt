Subject  Rental of Super 8 Motel

Dear Councilperson   

How much is the city actually budgeting for this move  Does our cost stop at the  1 000 000 for rental  How
much are we budgeting for repairs during and after the rental  My guess is that our total housing cost  not
including social services  will be at least  75 000 room per year  Is this the best  most efficient use of city
funds   

Or is the proposal to just rent the Super 8 and not budget all the costs other than the direct rental 
  Please spend our revenue wisely 

Thanks and best regards 

Steve Lipson
