To Whom It May Concern 

  am writing to urge you to oppose Japan s discharge of 1 3 million tons of radioactive waste into the
Pacific Ocean  It is absolutely false that such a  dump  poses no risk to public health  human  animal
and vegetal  It is also untrue that the resultant radioactivity will not reach our coast  Much of the
detritus from the tsunami and implo sion of the power plant landed along the California coast  The
same will happen if the huge amount of toxic water is dumped   

  hope you will adopt the Resollution on Consent tomorrow night toward stopping this dangerous
release    hope you will not be swayed by the Breakthrough Institute s bogus science on this
question  This plan by the Japanese Government puts the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in jeopardy 
Thank you for your attention to this very serious situation 

Sincerely 

Linda Roman

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
