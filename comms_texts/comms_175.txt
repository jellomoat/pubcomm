Dear Mayor Arreguin and City Council members 

  live in Portland  Oregon  downriver from the Hanford Nuclear Weapons site  and   know that dumping Fukushima
wastes into the Pacific for the next 30 plus years would be a tragic mistake 

Please support this resolution
To oppose this plan 

The ocean is life 

Respectfully 
Laura Feldman
Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
