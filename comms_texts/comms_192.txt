Dear Honorable Mayor and Berkeley Councilmembers 

The support for daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park is strong  Please see the attached 247
signatures asking the Berkeley City Council to 

 SU pport a full exploration of daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park 

Limiting the creek to just a  partial flow  could interfere with grant opportunities  We ask that language be
added in the Motion tonight to allow for a full exploration of restoring the creek  to include a potential  full

flow design  Please help us identify a design that can support the many important current  and future  uses
of the park while also adding the magic and appeal of a real  natural creek 

Youth love the idea of the creek  And so do parents
