Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council 

On July 11  2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan please give your full
support for the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park 

 ve lived in San Francisco and Berkeley for my whole life and doing a FULL restoration of Strawberry
Creek is an issue I m very passionate about 

  urge you to please advocate changing the description of the daylighting project from its current

phrasing to this   Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek  design and flow to be
determined thru future study 

The way the Civic Center Plan is written to describe the daylighting of the Creek says it is an  alternate
scenario  with just a  partial restoration    request that the Plan not assume any limitations on the
location and flow of the Creek  Please do a full planning and design study for the daylighting  The
above phrasing can help to secure funding 

Thank you 
Chase Hommeyer
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
