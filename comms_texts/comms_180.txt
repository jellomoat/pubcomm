Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council 

  hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits    am writing to express my deep concern
and strong opposition to the proposed release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean  As a concerned citizen of Berkeley    believe it is crucial for our
city to take a stand against this decision and protect the health and environment of our coastal
waters 

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant  as you are aware  experienced a catastrophic meltdown
following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami  The resulting contamination of water in the plant s
storage tanks has  posed an ongoing challenge for the Japanese government  However    firmly
believe that releasing this contaminated water into the ocean will have severe health and
environmental consequences  not only for Japan but also for coastal regions as far away as
California   

First and foremost  the release of contaminated water into the ocean poses significant health risks to
marine life and human populations  Radioactive isotopes such as tritium  cesium  and strontium are
known to accumulate in seafood  which could eventually find its way into our food chain  Studies have
shown that exposure to these isotopes can lead to various health issues  including an increased risk
of cancer  genetic mutations  and developmental abnormalities 

Furthermore  the marine ecosystem in the California coastal waters  which is already vulnerable to
numerous environmental threats  would be significantly impacted by the release of contaminated
water  The potential ecological damage cannot be underestimated  as radioactive isotopes could
harm marine organisms  disrupt the delicate balance of F ecosystems  and have far reaching
consequences for the health of our oceans 

 
Safer alternatives exist  including safe storage and radioactive decay  bioremediation  and use of
treated water to make concrete for special applications  the latter option has been proposed by the
Independent Expert Panel to the Pacific Islands Forum  Their paper is available at
https cafethorium whoi edu concrete option 

As a city known for its commitment to environmental stewardship and public health    urge the
Berkeley City Council to take a principled stance against the release of contaminated water from the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant    kindly request that the Council pass a resolution or issue a
statement expressing our opposition to this proposal    believe it is our moral obligation to protect the
well being of our coastal waters  marine life  and the health of our community 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter    trust that you will carefully consider the potential
risks and ramifications of releasing contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant 
Your decisive action would not only safeguard our environment but also set an example for other
communities to follow   

Yours sincerely 

Reiko Hasegawa

Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
