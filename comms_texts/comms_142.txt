Dear Council 

We at the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum  BHSM  are pleased that the Civic Center
planning has moved along this far  and we want to encourage you to vote to proceed  to the next
phase  It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to
serve its mission  to foster appreciation and understanding of our city s unique history by residents
and visitors alike through research  collection  preservation  exhibition and publication of historical
records  photographs  artifacts and other media   

Although a first floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence  there are
advantages to the current plan  which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall
space for exhibits on the other levels  We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take
place first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut
down  We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes  furnishings and
 equipment for BHSM spaces 

As you may know  the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with
Berkeley s centennial   There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City
Hall and the Acheson Building  and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City
Hall  We are now approaching the Society s 50th anniversary and the city s sesquicentennial in
2028  Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building  It is thirty years
this month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993  and it seems the building has received
minimal maintenance by the City since then  The main floor is overheated in the winter  the second
floor has no heat  and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition 

The Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained  for example  peeling paint on its exterior
woodwork will cause further damage  While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and
renovations to take place at some point in the future  we hope the City staff can find a way to attend
to some of these two buildings  sore needs in the meantime 

For several years we have been sending each of you our   quarterly newsletter containing articles  
about Berkeley history   If you would like it to go to your home address  please let me know  We
hope you have been able to read at least some issues and visit some of our exhibits and events  We
also encourage you to explore our new website  berkhistory org 

  We look forward to working in partnership with the City and the Community for a Cultural Civic Center
on bringing an exciting new vision for ine Civic Center complex into reality  Please feel free to contact
me if you have any questions 

 
Sincerely 
Ann Harlow

President  Berkeley Historical Society and Museum  on behalf of its Board of Directors
