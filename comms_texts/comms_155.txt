  Subject  Restore Strawberry Creek  Item  33   Civic Center Phase II   Design Concept Adoption

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council Members 

_ On July 11 please support the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park in the Civic Center Plan 

The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an  alternate scenario  using
the term  partial flow creek bed  The proposed Design for the creek should not assume any limitations on
the location and flow of the creek  A full planning and design study would give the Council a better sense of
what s possible and would be more likely to secure funding 

Therefore  please change the description of the  alternate design  from just a  partial flow  to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park  This can be done while still supporting the
other important park uses and activities 

Thank you 

Margot Cunningham
Richmond  CA
Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution approving Berkeley’s Civic Center Design Concept Plan, and declaring Council’s intention to support the preferred design concept and necessary future studies and projects articulated in the plan.
