Good afternoon
I m writing to support a vote FOR the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the government of Japan s
Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean that the council i is

considering at today s méeting   

We now know that dilution is not the solution to pollution  Rather  releasing this water will fundamentally change ocean
chemistry  both locally and across the Pacific as waste water is carried via currents  Following the tsunami and initial
disaster  radioactivity was detected in the flesh of tuna caught in California waters  Large fishes bio accumulate things
like PCBs  mercury  and radiation making their way back to humans when consumed  We already have a number of
precautionary warnings on fish shellfish consumption   it  seems madness to dump this water  laden with persistent
radioactive isotopes  into our food web 

Id like to encourage more collaboration between our excellent scientific minds at CAL and those in Japan to find
enduring solutions to cleaning up water contaminated by human activities around the world  Water  and fresh drinking
water in particular  is a finite resource  Why not put all best efforts into developing methods to separate and sequester
contaminates from water such that it can be returned to the environment without causing damage to wildlife and
human health 

Thanks for your time and attention
