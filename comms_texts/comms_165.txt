Subject      Item  5 on July 11  Agenda

Dear Mayor and Councilmembers 

  am writing to urge your support of Item  35 on the July 11 Agenda  This would eliminate criminal penalties for personal
use of entheogenic psychedelic plants and fungi 

Criminalizing these substances since the 1970s hasn t diminished their prevalence  Rather  criminalization has
marginalized these substances socially  encouraging their abuse and associated personal and social costs 

By eliminating criminal penalties for personal use of psychedelic plants and fungi  you promote a culture  of responsible
use and you reduce the need for expensive governmental drug enforcement 

Please do the right thing and support Item  35 next Tuesday 
Sincerely 

Karen Armstead
