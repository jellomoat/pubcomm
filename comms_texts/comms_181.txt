Dear Jesse Arreguin  Kate Harrison  Rashi Kesarwani  Terry Taplin  Ben Bartlett  Sophie Hahn  Susan Wengraf  Rigel

Robinson  and Mark Humbert 

  hope you re all doing well  I m reaching out to express my enthusiastic support for Councilmember Kate Harrison s
decision to include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan s Planned
Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on today s agenda at
the California Berkeley City Council 

As a concerned citizen who deeply values representatives who prioritize our planet s well being    believe it s crucial for
us to stand united on this important matter  Tokyo Electric Power Company recently made public its intention to release
radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks  This announcement has sparked global concern and
mobilized various groups worldwide to voice their apprehensions regarding the preservation of our precious oceans 

Numerous countries  such as Korea and Pacific Islands nations  along with countless institutions  global NGOs  and
dedicated fishers  have taken it upon themselves to raise awareness  explore alternative solutions  and pursue political
avenues to safeguard our marine ecosystems  Against this backdrop  the California Berkeley City Council will soon vote
on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan s Planned Discharge of
Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean 

  implore each of you to attentively listen to the stories  data  and experiences that will be shared during the Council
meeting  as they hold the potential to shape a brighter future for our oceans  The Ocean Health Cooperative  among
other esteemed organizations  will provide valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision making 

Considering the gravity of the situation    wholeheartedly recommend that the California Berkeley City Council embraces
the Resolution opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company  TEPCO  and the government of Japan s proposed release of
wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean  Furthermore    propose that copies
of this resolution be sent to Secretary Blinken  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Alex Padilla  and Representative

  Barbara Lee to raise awareness and garner support at the federal level 

It is of utmost importance to consider the context surrounding this issue  Back in 2015  radioactive contamination from
the Fukushima disaster reached California s shores  and on April 13  2021  the government of Japan announced TEPCO s
plan to discharge additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as early as Spring of 2023  This planned release raises
serious concerns about the health of our planet and the well being of future generations  Insufficient due diligence has
been undertaken to ensure the safety of this action  and numerous experts argue that TEPCO and the government of
Japan are proceeding without a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks involved 

While TEPCO and the government of Japan maintain that the wastewater has been adequately treated and poses no
environmental or health risks  scientific evidence contradicts their claims  Marine biologists  marine pollution experts 
and scientists have highlighted significant deficiencies in the due diligence process  particularly regarding the
effectiveness of the  Advanced Liquid Processing System   ALPS  the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site 
Regrettably  this system falls short in its ability to remove all radioactive materials before releasing the wastewater

Furthermore  in April 2021  three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights
Council expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives
and livelihoods in the Pacific region  They emphasized the substantial risks this poses to global environmental and
human rights   

It s worth mentioning that on March 6  2023  the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the
government of Japan s intended discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  By aligning
with the City of West Hollywood and joining the ranks of tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide  the City of
Berkeley can reassert its position as a leading global environmental advocate  fully committed to preserving our planet s
invaluable resources   

In conclusion    implore each of you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison s initiative and take a firm stance against
the planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean  By
adopting the proposed resolution  the California Berkeley City Council can showcase its unwavering dedication to
environmental stewardship and send a resounding message to decision makers at all levels 

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter    trust that you will conscientiously weigh the scientific evidence 
environmental implications  and concerns of the global community when casting your vote  Please do not hesitate to
reach out if there s any additional information or support   can provide 

Yours sincerely 

Desiree McGill
Recommendation: Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the César Chávez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguín’s and Councilmember Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.
