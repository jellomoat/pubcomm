To Whom It May Concern,

lam Seaver Wang, Co-Director of the Climate and Energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, a US-based environmental

nonprofit research center located in Berkeley, California. It has recently come to our attention that Berkeley City
Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose

Japan’s planned discharge of objectively harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

As a Berkeley-based environmental research institution with staff possessing special expertise in oceanography and
nuclear power plant safety, we find this proposed resolution to be a senseless distraction for the city’s public agenda
that is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally counterproductive and harmful to social justice.

As we establish in our attached letter, the proposed release of water poses zero risk to public health and environmental
safety off the coast of Japan, and certainly for Berkeley residents and businesses. We show that a person drinking
nothing but the treated water for an entire year would experience a fraction of the equivalent of a chest X-ray
procedure. We emphasize that the International Atomic Energy Agency has determined in their final report, released
this week, that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent with relevant
international safety standards.”

We have attached our comment on Councilmember Harrison's proposed resolution to this email as a PDF document. —

Yours sincerely,

To: Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council
From: Dr. Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute

Subject: We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison's Symbolic and Non-Scientific Proposed Resolution
Criticizing the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant.

Any visitor walking along Berkeley's sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after
house, in window after window: “In this house we believe science is real.” With Berkeley hosting one of the
nation’s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory, this communal respect for the
scientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody.

As such, we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new
resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan's planned discharge of objectively
harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Councilmember Harrison's resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated
water from the Fukushima facility. If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly
from the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) fora full year at the planned upper limit
concentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)’, their total added dose of radiation would be
0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)?,
and approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02
mSv).’ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health
Organization's threshold for tritium in drinking water.>

Dilution of the Fukushima release by a little over a factor of two would put the release well below the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold for tritium in water of 20,000 pCi/L. Needless to say, the vast
Pacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at
Fukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific
measurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring
background radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report
reviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy

_ Agency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent
with relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and I at the Breakthrough Institute would be
happy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that
the water is entirely safe. )

By the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation
process requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any
remaining additional radioactivity from the release. Clearly, Councilmember Kate Harrison's claim that the
release “could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region” and “imposes considerable
risks to environmental and human rights across the globe” amounts to nothing but sheer political theater.
The risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses"" is, quite literally, zero.

We further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to
quote represent explicitly anti-nuclear advocacy groups, including Greenpeace International, Friends of the
Earth, and No Nukes Action. These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained .
ideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against
climate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize
nuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison’s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically
rigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support
clean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources
in decarbonizing the global energy system.®

_ In response to Councilmember Harrison's invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear
misinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific

peoples because of the exaggerated discourse on the Fukushima water release issue. Anti-nuclear activists,
playing to radiation-related historical traumas and vastly inflating the public health and environmental
risks posed by the release, have inflicted and continue to inflict undue anxiety upon communities across
the Asia-Pacific, while threatening economic harm to the peoples of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki
Prefectures in Japan. These organizations would celebrate the shutdown of nuclear power stations across
Asia, even if this prolongs the continued operation of fossil fuel power plants that contribute to climate

change and would directly sicken more Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese people from.air pollution.

We strongly urge the other members of the Berkeley City Council to reject Councilmember Harrison's empty
resolution in the most forceful terms. And we rebuke Councilmember Harrison for occupying the city's
public agenda with a resolution that is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally
counterproductive and harmful to social justice.

Subject: Yes to Consent Item #29 - Oppose Discharge of Wamewater from Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Oceam

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or r attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.
Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council: ~

| am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley, to
urge you to adopt by consent the Resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the
Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into
the Pacific Ocean (Consent Item #29)” at tomorrow's Council meeting.

The government of Japan and TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) plan to soon begin dumping 1.3
million tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. Currents will bring it here and,
eventually, around the world. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from
Fukushima across the Pacific to California. Moreover, traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off
the coast of California since 2015. 70% of the water supposedly “treated” with the ALPS (Advanced Liquid
Processing System) which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for
discharge. Strontium-90, one of the radionuclides found in the “treated” water, is among the most hazardous
radionuclides; once in the body, Strontium-90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and
teeth, where it can cause the cancers of bone, bone marrow, and soft tissues around the bone. TEPCO’s
“safety” claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a
human body; once it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell
mutations. Because of TEPCO’s inadequate sampling practices, lack of data on what the water actually
contains, and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the
discharge, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.

The people ¢ of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea, China, the Philippines, as well as the Pacific -
Island nations, overwhelmingly oppose the dumping. The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of
international, independent, interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the
best solution, which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and, therefore, will have very
little contact with humans. While it may not be the perfect solution, the cement encasement is far safer than
dumping it in the ocean; the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released.

The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) which has approved the plan, has a contradictory dual
purpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time. For this
reason, the IAEA is often seen as biased. An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower
suggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from
the final report at the request of the Japanese government.

it is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future »
generations. | urge you to vote in support of the resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company |
and the Government of Japan’s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power

‘ Plant into the Pacific Ocean” at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th, on behalf of concerned
citizens like myself.

RE: Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park and Right-of-way Evaluation and Key
Considerations

Dear Councilmember Harrison;

L understand that a “required” right-of-way of 150’, taken from the 1999 Wolfe
Mason report, is being used to evaluate the potential for daylighting Strawberry
Creek at Civic Center Park. I am concerned that this value if far greater than what
might actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration, so I have
prepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating
the potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park.

The first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert
invert is 18’ below the surface. Based on this depth and empirical data of the
Strawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus, we prepared what I
would consider a minimal creek corridor width. I included typical stream bank
treatments such as armored “cut banks”, 2:1 slopes, small terracing walls, public
access paths, and a small amount of floodplain.

The exercise produced a 76’ right-of-way width. The second drawing was prepared
to show what that 76’ width would represent in plan-view when placed over Civic
Center Park. Together, these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie
depiction of a restored creek and right-of-way requirements.

I should add that the right-of-way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum
width but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to “fit” the restored
channel into the site and accommodate other park uses. It may also be appropriate
to widen the creek right-of-way in other locations to better integrate the resource
into the broader park program.

I believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language
that emphasizes the need for ""full restoration,"" and that allows for the consideration
of alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site. I hope that these
drawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the
evaluation of more specific design alternatives.

A full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of
Strawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would
conform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design.

Key points:

e Drawing A represents a minimum Right of Way (ROW) necessary to provide
significant ecological services associated with robust riparian ecosystems.

e Drawing B represents - and shows - the minimum ROW required in a plan
view for informational and discussion purposes, but does xof represent a
specific design plan.

¢ Specific design plans and alternatives would be developed in a fully public,
transparent planning and design process, which would incorporate the
ecological requirements of a restored riparian corridor, as well as the adjacent
conditions related to Civic Center Park, and the input of the community's
many stakeholders.

e The grant program under which California Urban Streams Partnership
(CUSP) has been selected to submit a full grant application, specifically
builds in this public process as part of the grant parameters. Thus, design
and planning alternatives - and the process through which these are
developed - would be funded under this grant, if CUSP and the City were to
receive it.

I hope that this is helpful to the City’s planning Process and please don’t hesitate to
contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the

Dear Council:

We at the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum (BHSM) are pleased that the Civic Center
planning has moved along this far, and we want to encourage you to vote to proceed. to the next
phase. It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to
serve its mission: to foster appreciation and understanding of our city’s unique history by residents
and visitors alike through research, collection, preservation, exhibition and publication of historical
records, photographs, artifacts and other media. ;

Although a first-floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence, there are
advantages to the current plan, which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall
space for exhibits on the other levels. We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take
place first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut
down. We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes, furnishings and
-equipment for BHSM spaces.

As you may know, the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with
Berkeley’s centennial. (There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City
Hall and the Acheson Building, and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City
Hall.) We are now approaching the Society’s 50th anniversary and the city’s sesquicentennial in
2028. Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building. It is thirty years
this month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993, and it seems the building has received
minimal maintenance by the City since then. The main floor is overheated in the winter, the second
floor has no heat, and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition.

The Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained; for example, peeling paint on its exterior
woodwork will cause further damage. While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and
renovations to take place at some point in the future, we hope the City staff can find a way to attend
to some of these two buildings’ sore needs in the meantime.

For several years we have been sending each of you our + quarterly newsletter containing articles .
about Berkeley history. (If you would like it to go to your home address, please let me know.) We
hope you have been able to read at least some issues and visit some of our exhibits and events. We
also encourage you to explore our new website, berkhistory.org.

~ We look forward to working in partnership with the City and the Community for a Cultural Civic Center
on bringing an exciting new vision for ine Civic Center complex into reality. Please feel free to contact
me if you have any questions.

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council Members,

_-On July 11 please support the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park in the Civic Center Plan.

The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an “alternate scenario"" using
the term “partial flow creek bed”. The proposed Design for the creek should not assume any limitations on
the location and flow of the creek. A full planning and design study would give the Council a better sense of
what's possible and would be more likely to secure funding.

Therefore, please change the description of the ""alternate design"" from just a ""partial flow"" to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. This can be done while still supporting the
other important park uses and activities.

RE: Civic Center Plan, July 11 Consent calendar item #33

The Civic Center Plan is excellent and should be accepted with one addendum: the condition of the Strawberry Creek
- culvert has not been sufficiently explored including the options of what to do with this aging infrastructure that runs
under the Maudelle Shirek Building (Old City Hall). There are at least three maps that show its course, and they are
attached. In the Plan, the map is on page 107.

Since Old City Hall was built in 1909, the concrete composing the 9 foot in diameter culvert would be at least that old,
and has already failed in several places, as the City map attached shows. Rebuilding on top of this ancient aqueduct is

unthinkable given the potential for extreme downpours and flooding due to climate change.

No thought has been given in this plan to the options for reinforcing or rerouting the culvert north of the Shirek Building
between it and the public safety building and the costs involved.

Any consideration of a water feature such as partial daylighting of the creek is premature and should wait on the
- recommendations of a study of the culvert’s condition and available options. )

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council,

On July 11, 2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan. One of the most
important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. | ask for
your full support.

I’ve lived in Berkeley most of my life. As a child, | loved visiting Live Oak Park with its creek. Now | love
visiting Strawberry Creek Park, looking at the creek bouncing over the stones and watching the children
enjoy themselves there. We all need nature for our mental health—birds, creeks, trees. | would love to
see a fully daylighted creek downtown.

The Civic Center Plan describes the daylighting of the Creek as an ""alternate scenario"" with just a
“partial restoration”. | ask that the Plan not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the
‘Creek. A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what’s possible and would be
more likely to secure funding. Therefore, | ask you to change the description of the ""alternate plan"",
from just a “partial flow"" to this: “Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek, design and flow

to be determined thru future study.”
Thank you,

Nancy Schimmel

July 10, 2023

To: City Council

From: Chairperson Enchill on behalf of the Landmarks Preservation  oninission (LPC) -
Vote: 8-0-0-1

Regarding: Berkeley Civic Center Planning

Members of the City Council:

The Landmarks Preservation Commission has watched with interest, periodic
participation, and encouragement the lengthy planning process for renovation of
Berkeley’s Civic Center. By and large, from a preservation standpoint, the process has’
worked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to
historic issues. We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on
next steps. The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically:

1.

Calls for and supports, as a general principle, the restoration, refurbishment, and
sensitive adaptive re-use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and
the park, rather than their radical replacement, demolition, or alteration;

supports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives
connected to the Civic Center (including the LPC, Civic Arts, Parks & Waterfront,
Disability, and Transportation / Public Works). The ongoing subcommittee has been,
and should remain, a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues,
interact with staff, consultants, and the public, and advise the Council on planning
proposals and projects for the Civic Center. The subcommittee can particularly serve
as a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024-2027 “research, schematic
design and approvals funding plan, design development” phase;

supports, and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with
further planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek
Building and the Veterans Building, particularly funding for seismic
strengthening. There should be no substantial pause in planning. These are highly
important structures that are both historic and useful, and the City should make it a
high priority to bring both of them back into full use. Both buildings are currently living
on borrowed time, given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the
Bay Area;

Page 1 of 5

----
. supports full accessibility for the buildings, with a design approach that also
minimizes impacts / alterations to the main facades. If the zig-zag ramp on the
front of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned / modified or replaced use of the
State Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to
better harmonize with the historic front steps / facade;

. supports recommendations of the consultant / staff reports that emphasize .
restoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings, both inside and out,
including original finishes, details, and maintaining general historic interior
layout. The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through
adaptive design, as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors.
Use of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent
possible. .

. supports, in concept, the addition of infill structures placed behind the two
buildings to expand their useable square footage. Additions should be
designed and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
do not detract from, compete with, or alter the principal facades of the historic
buildings;

. supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to
one or both courtyards of the Veterans Building. Courtyard infill would
considerably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a
large number of simultaneous arts events and activities, and is also best
constructed in conjunction with overall building renovations. The courtyards are
near-ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have
an impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building;

. supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck / event space to the roof
_ of the Veterans Building, so long as it is designed in such a way that it is
concealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic
facade, especially when seen from across the park;

. supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses, including
performing arts and visual arts. Supports the broadest possible access of arts
and community groups to the building, rather than exclusive or extensive use of
the building for / by a small number of groups / organizations;

hall) for City and civic meeting and educational use, including maximizing the
provision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes, so
several meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building,
and so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual
and in-person participation;

. supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley

Community Media and the Berkeley Historical Society & Museum (BHSM).
Both uses are compatible with the history / use of the building. Berkeley
Community Media also provides support for civic meetings (such as broadcast of
Council and Commission meetings), while BHSM’s proposed operation of a
museum and history research center would bring users to the building;

supports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city
programs interested in local history (such as the History Room in the Public
Library) to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a “one-stop” center
of local historical education, research, display, and archives;

supports, in particular, the preservation and re-use of specific key historic
spaces in both buildings including: within the Veterans Building, the fine
auditorium, and four lodge / meeting rooms, and extensive lobby; within the
Maudelle Shirek Building, the interior halls and grand staircase, and the
historic Council Chambers on the upper floor (the Council Chamber room is
currently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as |
Commissions that expect a considerable audience).

supports the creation of a new, large, multipurpose room addition to the rear of
the Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large
Commission meetings, as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use
and activities. The room should be designed flexibly without fixed / built-in seating
or furniture, so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses;

encourages consideration of moving Berkeley’s Visitor Center to the Shirek
Building to bring more users, tourists, and visitors to the Civic Center;

Pe.

encourages providing both buildings with ‘catering kitchens’ and support
infrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and
rental events such as receptions, social gatherings, and even meals / dinner events;

calls for, and supports creation of, a comprehensive interpretive signage and
website program that would educate the public about the history and
development of the Civic Center; |

opposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from
elsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building. This
would do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses / users,
and would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active
uses. In addition, an approach that emphasizes “more city staff offices” will simply
not resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to
future Civic Center renovations; discourages any pre-reservation or design of space
in the buildings for programs that do not currently exist;

notes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local
veterans organizations, which were large and active at the time it was built.
Permanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a
means for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have
ongoing and affordable access to meeting / event space in the Civic Center;

encourages the City to plan, renovate, and manage the Civic Center buildings
so they can be rented—when not in civic uses such as public meetings or
community arts events—for uses, both small and large, from concerts, festivals,
and fairs to meetings, conventions, and conferences. If effectively designed and
managed the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to
hold conferences and events, while also producing income for the City;

. encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so

the Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus, which is the
largest indoor theater space in Berkeley, can be restored and integrated into
Civic Center activities and use;

generally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green
spaces and existing trees, provides unobtrusive infrastructure (bathrooms, power

Page 4 of 5

----
sources, lighting, etc.) to support multiple uses, emphasizes not only event use, but
supports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users, reuses
rather than unnecessarily demolishes, existing hardscape, emphasizes the park as a
harmonious, historic, and generally symmetrical civic space, and brings water back
to the fountain; discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that
unnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future
functionality; :

23.Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non-historic parking lot
behind 2180 Milvia, at the east end of the park, and supports integration of this
area into the park space overall. A portion of this area could (as plans currently
propose) remain hardscape, not for daily parking, but for use as a Staging area for
larger events within the park;

24.supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large
gatherings, festivals, and similar events. Opposes construction of new
permanent structures (particularly buildings) in the park space, and encourages
event facilities to be designed unobtrusively (for example, it should be planned and
possible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park, but building big
outdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses /
users. The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages.)

25. Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center
(including memorial trees, and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the
buildings) be fully identified, maintained, and protected, particularly memorials
to veterans. Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained.

26. Reserves judgment on the possibility of “daylighting” Strawberry Creek within
the Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted.
The LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies / proposals for
daylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential
impact on the historic design and character of the park in particular. The LPC
encourages all, including the City and private groups, studying daylighting to
take into account two key issues: preserving the overall physical framework /
historic character / design of the Civic Center; ensuring ample and adequate access
for the public, especially for disabled t users, to the buildings and outdoor spaces of
the Civic Center.

Dear Berkeley City Council,

I’m grateful to you for hearing the matter to decriminalize (deprioritize) entheogenic plants and
fungi. |am a former English instructor at Berkeley City College (2001-2011), an Oakland Pen
‘award-winning poet and filmmaker who resides here in Berkeley. | am also a member of
Psychedelics in Recovery, a 12-step based fellowship whose members use psychedelics in their
personal work to recover from maladaptive behaviors, such as addiction. | am also a member in
good standing of Sacred Garden Community Church, an entheogenic church based in Oakland, CA.

| am asking for your support for this resolution on entheogenic plants and fungi, and for removal
of restrictions on sharing in the second resolved statement. In my church the sharing of —
sacraments is a sacred act, equivalent of the sharing of the Host in Christian churches, or the
sharing of the Seder plate in Judaism. This second resolved statement will complicate, if not
prohibit, that practice and infringe on our rights to practice our faith in the full freedom granted
to us under our Constitution. | therefore plead with you to remove that clause to allow our
members to.practice their faith without undue complications. :

Thank you for considering the decriminalization of these sacred plants and removing restrictions
on their use. Hundreds of thousands, and historically, millions, have found healing with these
sacred medicines, and your courage in allowing people to work with these plants as they feel need
will add to the growing movement to bring this unspeakably inhumane, infantilizing and |
destructive, even criminal, “War on Drugs” under which the country has suffered for far too long.

Sincerely,
Clifton Ross

Dear Mayor and Councilmembers:

| am writing to urge your support of Item #35 on the July 11 Agenda. This would eliminate criminal penalties for personal
use of entheogenic/psychedelic plants and fungi.

Criminalizing these substances since the 1970s hasn't diminished their prevalence. Rather, criminalization has
marginalized these substances socially, encouraging their abuse and associated personal and social costs.

By eliminating criminal penalties for personal use of psychedelic plants and fungi, you promote a culture ‘of responsible
use and you reduce the need for expensive governmental drug enforcement.

Please do the right thing and support Item #35 next Tuesday.
Sincerely,

Karen Armstead

Dear Councilperson, »

How much is the city actually budgeting for this move? Does our cost stop at the $1,000,000 for rental? How
much are we budgeting for repairs during and after the rental? My guess is that our total housing cost, not
including social services, will be at least $75,000/room per year. Is this the best, most efficient use of city
funds? .

Or is the proposal to just rent the Super 8 and not budget all the costs other than the direct rental?
. Please spend our revenue wisely.

Thanks and best regards,

TO: Honorable Members of the City Council
FROM: Councilmember Harrison, Mayor Arreguin, and Councilmember Hahn

SUBJECT:  Relinquishment of Council Office Budget Funds and Co-Sponsorship of
the César Chavez Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project

RECOMMENDATION

Adopt a resolution approving an expenditure of D13 funds and cosponsorship of the
César Chavez/Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project, with $250 relinquished to
the City’s general fund for this purpose each from Mayor Arreguin’s and Councilmember
Harrison’s discretionary Council Office Budget Funds, and from any other
Councilmembers who would like to contribute.

BACKGROUND

The current statewide curricula that covers the life and work of labor and environmental
organizers, César Chavez and Dolores Huerta, does not adequately cover their rich
legacies nor their direct impact on Berkeley. However, new lesson plans developed as
part of the “Cesar Chavez Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project” will include
both in-class and experiential learning at the tribute site on the waterfront at Berkeley’s
César Chavez Park. The founders of the curriculum project, Santiago Casal and Beatriz
Levya-Cutler, aim to “...honor the equitable relationship, work and words of César and
Dolores and others in the farmworker struggle. The synergy of their partnership is what
made them highly effective.”

Casal and Levya-Cutler plan to apply for the Berkeley Public Schools Fund grant,
LEARNING for Equity, which provides $1,000 - $15,000 grants to projects focused on
addressing systemic oppression through strategic, justice-oriented programming. This
funding would allow complete curriculum implementation across Berkeley schools by
Spring 2024. The funds provided by Council discretionary budgets, will help provide
supplemental compensation for teacher leaders who will utilize summer 2023 to develop
prototypes and recruit grade-level teacher consultants. It is in the public interest to
donate to this project which serves the fundamental. municipal purpose of education.

FISCAL IMPACTS OF RECOMMENDATION
No General Fund impact. $250 is available from Mayor Arreguin and Councilmember
Harrison’s office accounts.

CITY SPONSORSHIP OF THE CESAR CHAVEZ DOLORES HUERTA
TRIBUTE SITE CURRICULUM FOR BERKELEY STUDENTS

WHEREAS, César Chavez and Dolores Huerta were civil and human rights activists, labor
leaders, and environmental justice organizers who dedicated their lives to the earth, to
agriculture, and to the farmworkers; and

WHEREAS, the synergy of their partnership and combined legacy uplifts workers across
the world; and

WHEREAS, the City of Berkeley re-named Berkeley’s Waterfront Park as César Chavez
Park in 1996 and the City of Berkeley supported the creation of a solar calendar at the
Park as a tribute to these two social and environmental justice warriors; and

WHEREAS, Dolores Huerta is, to this day, a long- standing community advocate and
promotes the educational importance of land stewardship; and

WHEREAS, the Chavez/Huerta curriculum will expose students in Berkeley’s public
schools to the importance of service to the community and to four virtues located in the
four directions of the Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site: Hope (East), Determination (South),
Courage (West), and Tolerance/Non-Violence (North); and

WHEREAS, the children and students of Berkeley now more than ever need and want to
inherit a planet that is safe and sustainable.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Council of the City of Berkeley that funds
relinquished by Mayor Arreguin and Councilmember Harrison from their Office budgets of
up to $250 each and from their office budgets of an amount to be determined by other
Councilmembers, shall be granted to the Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project to

-Subject: Relinquishment of Council Office Budget Funds for Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site

RECOMMENDATION .

Adopt a Resolution approving the expenditure of up to $5,000 from Mayor Arreguin, and
any other Councilmembers, to the Kala Art Institute, the fiscal sponsor for the
Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site, with funds relinquished from the City’s General Fund for the
purpose of hiring of grounds keepers and providing the resources needed for the
maintenance of the Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site, from the discretionary Council Office
Budgets of Mayor Arreguin and any other Councilmembers who would like to contribute.

BACKGROUND

The Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site’, located at Cesar Chavez Park along Spinnaker Way,
is centered around a lush green space overlooking the Bay Area. Instead of a single
statue or monument for the farmworker and labor organizer by which the park is named
after, the site has intentionally developed a comprehensive urban solar/lunar calendar,
along with a quartet of stones engraved with four virtues of the Farmworkers Movement:
Determination, Courage, Hope, and Tolerance. The site draws from design concepts in
art, astronomy, and architecture found at ancient and indigenous sky observatory sites
from around the world. The site seeks to promote an understanding of the Rhythm of

- the Seasons, the work, life, and values of Cesar E. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, provide
an outdoor classroom to study science, math, and culture, and create a space for
reflection and peace along the Berkeley shoreline. The site also contains a virtual tour,
which can be activated using your mobile device, and a physical, self-explanatory sign
to assist visitors with utilizing the solar calendar and position of stones to understand its
relationship to solstice and equinox.

A sum of $5,000 is being sought by the caretakers of the Chavez/Huerta Tribute Site to
go towards fees associated with employing gardeners, hauling soil, conducting stone
replacement, composting goods, grounds maintenance, upgrading signage, and paying
the Kala Art Institute a fiscal agent fee.

Subject: In support of the Resolution (Consent Item #29) Opposing Tokyo Electric Power

Company and the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from
‘Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.

My name is Tsukuru Fors. | am an anti-nuclear/human rights activist based in Los Angeles, California. | grew
up in Hiroshima, Japan, and am a graduate of a high school where 350 young lives were brutally taken on
August 6, 1945. Spending my formative years surrounded by people who were directly affected by the
intergenerational traumas of the atrocity has prompted me to advocate for all victims of nuclear disasters
globally in the past and present.

| have been made aware of the recent efforts to discredit a resolution championed by councilmember Kate
Harrison to oppose TEPCO/the government of Japan’s plan of dumping radioactive wastewater from the
crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In the letter that was addressed to city council members to
discourage them from voting yes on the resolution, the recent approval issued by the IAEA (International
Atomic Energy Agency) was cited. | felt the need to respond to that. ,

| am not going to debate the validity of the IAEA report/approval here. Rather, once again | would like to cite
the findings published by a board of five experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum. The findings
point out that TEPCO has neither done enough due- “diligence nor yr provided enough data to ascertain the safety
of the proposed plan.

Among the critical failings with TEPCO's “safety” claim, two things stand out to me. One is their lack of analysis
with regards to the transboundary issues. Wastewater released by Japan is not going to stay in and around
Japan; therefore, the concerns of neighboring nations such as South Korea, the Philippines, China, and the
Pacific Island nations should be seriously considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the potential —
risks are not limited to the Asia-Pacific region. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported
radionuclides from Fukushima across the Pacific to California.

The other is the matter of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration. Radionuclides such as Tritium and Strontium
90 can pass various levels of the food chain and be “bio-accumulated.” The higher up the food chain, the
higher the level of the contamination. In fish like Cod that are relatively high up in the food chain, the
concentration can be 2,000-6,000 times higher than the level naturally found in the water. TEPCO’s claim does
not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a human body, either:
once it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell mutations.
Because of these failings, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa and who is among the board of experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands
Forum, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.

Lastly, | would like to appeal to the moral and ethical responsibility that we have, as citizens of the United
States, to the people of the Pacific Island nations and future generations worldwide. The question that | want
us to ask ourselves is this: should we be treating the oceans as a dumping ground? Haven't the world’s oceans
been polluted and stressed enough? The people of the Pacific Island nations have been victimized for decades
by the nuclear ambitions of more “powerful” nations. For Japan to release wastewater from the damaged

f

----
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is a gross disregard for their livelihood and ocean way of life. For us,
citizens of the United States, not to oppose such’a plan is to be complicit in the act of nuclear colonialism.

| was born and raised in Japan but immigrated to the United States of America. | have raised my child here and
enjoyed the beaches and the ocean as a resident of California. It is my obligation to do everything in my power
to protect the environment and leave it as clean as possible for future generations. | am pleading to you,
honorable members of the Berkeley City Council, to act on your conscience and to do your part in being good
stewards of our planet.

Sincerely,

Tsukuru Fors

Importance: High

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.
Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council:

We urge you to adopt the Resolution on consent tomorrow night towards stopping the dangerous release of 1.3 |
million tons (and counting) of radioactive water from Fukushima into the Pacific. The dangers are proven by hard |
science, but you need not read the peer-reviewed studies and the pleas from the Pacific Island Forum's
independent, international team of scientists, from the government of Korea, etc. It is common sense that releasing
that huge amount of nuclear waste water into the ocean, on top of other releases, cannot be in the interest of public —
health or the Pacific flora/fauna. Keeping it on site is best, and using it to make concrete as recommended by the
interdisciplinary experts mentioned above.

As you know, the nuclear industry is extremely powerful and hires skilled marketing professionals, as well as funding
biased “think tanks”, to maximize profits. Do not be confused by the Breakthrough Institute’s profit-driven

_ misstatements of fact. Even the [AEA has been bought out, with promoting nuclear energy being the major part of
its mission.

If you have any reservations, about passing the Resolution by consent, please be sure to read this:

Dear Councilwoman Harrison, Mr. Mayor.and Berkeley City Council,

As a Berkeley resident and director of an ocean health non profit- Shark Stewards a project of The Earth Island Institute,
we support your resolution to oppose the Tokyo Electric Power Company proposal to release contaminated wastewater |
form Fukushima. ;

Despite opposition of The Pacific.lsland Forum scientists, Japanese citizens and neighboring governments, the Tokyo
Electric Power Company (TEPCO) intends to move ahead in discharging thousands of tons of radioactive wastewater into |
the ocean in coming weeks.

Along with other citizens and non protits ss we are sharing our voice on behalf of the ocean and ocean health eppeenip this
release.

In care and protection of our ocean, South Korea, other Pacific Islands nations, hundreds of institutions, global NGOs, and
thousands of fishers have ail risen to the responsibility of creating educational awareness, alternative solutions, and
political resolutions to this pivotal decision, as this precedent-setting event approaches over the horizon.

We encourage you to reject the letter sent by industry advocate Breakthru Institute with their specious argument lumping
ocean non profits as No Nuke groups, and obfuscating risk of exposure.

We are representing public and environmental health interests, and Tesco’s “dilution and dumping solution” instead of
available treatment technologies.

Although currents may take 3 or more years to reach us, migratory marine megafauna such as bluefin tuna take less than
a year.

Untreated Beta emitting molecules such as tritium pose an internal exposure risk to vertebrates, and potentially impact
more than human health, but also coral reefs and Pacific marine life.

Breakthru’s statement that ""The risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses’ is, quite literally, zero,"" is in direct conflict

with the City of Berkeley's global championship of the rights of people and the environment. By adopting the proposed
resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship —
and justice and send a. powerful message to decision-makers at all levels.

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will consider the scientific evidence, environmental

implications, and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote.
Please feel free to contact me if there is any additional information or support | can provide.

Subject: Urgent Support Needed: Resolution Opposing Fukushima Wastewater Discharge

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.

Dear Jesse Arreguin, Kate Harrison, Rashi Kesarwani, Terry Taplin, Ben Bartlett, Sophie Hahn, Susan Wengraf,

Rigel Robinson and Mark Humbert,

| hope this email finds you well. | am writing to express my strong support for Councilmember Kate Harrison's decision
to include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of
Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on tomorrow's agenda at the
California Berkeley City Council. |

As a concerned citizen who respects and honors representatives sensitive to the needs of our planet, we must act in
solidarity with our friends in this crucial matter. Recently, Tokyo Electric Power Company announced its intention to
move forward with discharging radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This development has
prompted various groups worldwide to unite and voice their concerns regarding the protection of our oceans.

In caring for and safeguarding our marine ecosystems, countries like Korea, Pacific Islands nations, numerous
institutions, global NGOs, and thousands of fishers have assumed the responsibility of creating educational awareness,
exploring alternative solutions, and seeking political resolutions. It is against this backdrop that the California Berkeley
City Council will be voting on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan's
Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.

| urge you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences shared during the Council meeting, as they may
shape a better future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among other organizations, will present valuable
information that can contribute to informed decision-making.

In light of the gravity of the situation, | recommend that the California Berkeley City Council adopts the Resolution
opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan's plan to discharge wastewater from the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | suggest that copies of this resolution be
sent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative Barbara Lee, in order to
raise awareness and garner support at the federal level.

It is crucial to consider the background surrounding this issue. Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima disaster
reached California's shores in 2015, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO's plan to release
additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as soon as Spring of 2023. This proposed discharge raises alarming
concerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has been
conducted to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts have argued that TEPCO and the government of
Japan are proceeding without a proper understanding of the potential risks involved.

While TEPCO and the government of Japan assert that the wastewater has been treated and poses no environmental or
health risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Many marine biologists, marine pollution experts, and scientists
have highlighted significant shortcomings in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the ""Advanced Liquid
Processing System"" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site. This system is incapable of removing all
radioactive materials before the release.

----
Furthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights
Council expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives
and livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the considerable risks posed to environmental and human rights
globally.

It is important to note that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the

_ government of Japan's planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By joining the
City of West Hollywood and tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of Berkeley can reaffirm its
position as a global environmental leader, committed to protecting our planet's natural resources.

In conclusion, | implore you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison's initiative and take a stand against the planned
discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By adopting the
proposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental
stewardship and send a powerful message to decision-makers at all levels.

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will consider the scientific evidence, environmental
implications, and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please let me know if there is any
additional information or support | can provide.

Subject: We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison's Symbolic and Non-Scientific Proposed Resolution
Criticizing the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant.

Any visitor walking along Berkeley's sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after
house, in window after window: “In this house we believe science is real.” with Berkeley hosting one of the
nation’s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory, this communal respect for the
scientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody.

As such, we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new
resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan's planned discharge of objectively
harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Councilmember Harrison's resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated
water from the Fukushima facility. If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly
from the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) for a full year at the planned upper limit
concentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)!, their total added dose of radiation would be
0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)’,
and approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02
mSv).‘ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health
Organization’s threshold for tritium in drinking water.°

Dilution of the Fukushima release by a little over a factor of two would put the release well below the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's threshold for tritium in water of 20,000 pCi/L. Needless to say, the vast
Pacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at
Fukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific
measurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring
background radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report
reviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy -
Agency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent
with relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and Tat the Breakthrough Institute would be
happy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that
the water is entirely safe...

By the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation
process requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any
remaining additional radioactivity from the release. Clearly, Councilmember Kate Harrison's claim that the
release “could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region” and “imposes considerable.
risks to environmental and human rights across the globe” amounts to nothing but sheer political theater.
The risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses” is, quite literally, zero.

We further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to
quote represent explicitly anti-nuclear advocacy groups, including Greenpeace International, Friends of the
Earth, and No Nukes Action. These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained
ideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against
climate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize
nuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison's draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically
rigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support
clean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources
in decarbonizing the global energy system.® .

In response to Councilmember Harrison’s invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear
misinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific

peoples because of the exaggerated discourse on the Fukushima water release issue. Anti-nuclear activists,
‘playing to radiation-related historical traumas and vastly inflating the public health and environmental
risks posed by the release, have inflicted arid continue to inflict undue anxiety upon communities across
the Asia-Pacific, while threatening economic harm to the peoples of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki
Prefectures in Japan. These organizations would celebrate the shutdown of nuclear power stations across
Asia, even if this prolongs the continued operation of fossil fuel power plants that contribute to climate
change and would directly sicken more Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese people from air pollution.

We strongly urge the other members of the Berkeley City Council to reject Councilmember Harrison's empty
resolution in the most forceful terms. And we rebuke Councilmember Harrison for occupying the city’s
public agenda with a resolution that is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally
counterproductive and harmful to social justice.

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is

Dear Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council:

| am writing to express my strong support for councilmember Kate Harrison's Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power
Company (TEPCO) and the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on today's agenda at Berkeley City Council.

Untrustworthy players
As we know, the Fukushima incident was preventable, but happened due to bad decisions and poor leadership (all you

have to do is google ""was Fukushima preventable"" to see the multitud of evidence). Sadly, in more than a decade since,
TEPCO has still not changed. In the 18 months that the expert panel has reviewed TEPCO's data, they've been disturbed

by the poor data collection methods, data that don't line up with science, and obfuscation by the authorities.

Unfortunately, the International Atomic.Energy Agency (IAEA) both promotes nuclear energy, and is its own watchdog.
An inherent conflict of interests. Also, about 10% of the IAEA's operating budget comes from Japan (and did in 2021, see
page 131). So the IAEA cannot be trusted to be unbiased in this case.

Outdated safety standards

As we have worked directly with the third panel party of experts, they keep hammering this home: the safety standards
are not in line with the latest science. The IAEA’s safety standards for tritium don’t make a distinction between
men and.women, there is one estimate for generic “adults” which shows its safety standards are also
discriminatory against women, AND the most recent data and research they cite is from 2004, nearly twenty
years ago. Yet we know that women and children are more sensitive to the effects of radiation. US drinking

water’s standard limit was set without detailed assessment of what it would take to protect the embryo or the
fetus, especially in the first trimester.

Common sense, safer alternatives |

. The scientific community agrees—we cannot keep dumping waste in our environment. Especially when, in TEPCO's case,
the waste can be made into cement, safely stored, and actually used for ongoing construction on-site. We must follow
the Precautionary Principle. This is such a no brainer, it hurts.

Many parts of the US and California look to Berkeley as a shining example of how to push past outdated view, laws, and
science, as Berkeley shepherds in progressive laws and policies that the rest of California follows.

| trust that you'll vote to uphold public and environmental health and safety in this case.

Here is more reference material from the expert panel.

Thank you for your time, and important work.

Subject: Opposition to the Release of Contaminated Water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Plant ,

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.

Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council,

| hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. | am writing to express my deep concern and strong
opposition to the proposed release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the
Pacific Ocean. As a concerned citizen of Berkeley, | believe it is crucial for our city to take a stand against this
decision and protect the health and environment of our coastal waters. |

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as you are aware, experienced a catastrophic meltdown following the
2011 earthquake and tsunami. The resulting contamination of water in the plant's storage tanks has posed an
ongoing challenge for the Japanese government. However, | firmly believe that releasing this contaminated
water into the ocean will have severe health and environmental consequences, not only for Japan but also for
coastal regions as far away as California.

First and foremost, the release of contaminated water into the ocean poses significant health risks to marine
life and human populations. Radioactive isotopes such as tritium, cesium, and strontium are known to
accumulate in seafood, which could eventually find its way into our food chain. Studies have shown that
exposure to these isotopes can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of cancer, genetic
mutations, and developmental abnormalities. |

Furthermore, the marine ecosystem in the California coastal waters, which is already vulnerable to numerous
environmental threats, would be significantly impacted by the release of contaminated water. The potential
ecological damage cannot be underestimated, as radioactive isotopes could harm marine organisms, disrupt
the delicate balance of ecosystems, and have far-reaching consequences for the health of our oceans.

Safer alternatives exist, including safe storage and radioactive decay, bioremediation, and use of treated water
to make concrete for special applications (the latter option has been proposed by the Independent Expert

Panel to the Pacific Islands Forum. Their paper is available at https://cafethorium.whoi.edu/concrete-option/).

As a city known for its commitment to environmental stewardship and public health, | urge the Berkeley City
Council to take a principled stance against the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear plant. | kindly request that the Council pass a resolution or issue a statement expressing our
opposition to this proposal. | believe it is our moral obligation to protect the well-being of our coastal waters,
marine life, and the health of our community.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. | trust that you will carefully consider the potential risks
and ramifications of releasing contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Your decisive
action would not only safeguard our environment but also set an example for other communities to follow.

To Whom It May Concern,

| am writing to urge you to oppose Japan's discharge of 1.3 million tons of radioactive waste into the
Pacific Ocean. It is absolutely false that such a ""dump"" poses no risk to public health, human, animal

detritus from the tsunami and implo-sion of the power plant landed along the California coast. The
same will happen if the huge amount of toxic water is dumped. .

| hope you will adopt the Resollution on Consent tomorrow night toward stopping this dangerous
release. | hope you will not be swayed by the Breakthrough Institute's bogus science on this

Good afternoon
I’m writing to support a vote FOR the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the government of Japan’s
Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean that the council i is

considering at today’s méeting. :

We now know that dilution is not the solution to pollution. Rather, releasing this water will fundamentally change ocean
chemistry, both locally and across the Pacific as waste water is carried via currents. Following the tsunami and initial
disaster, radioactivity was detected in the flesh of tuna caught in California waters. Large fishes bio-accumulate things
like PCBs, mercury, and radiation making their way back to humans when consumed. We already have a number of
precautionary warnings on fish/shellfish consumption — it. seems madness to dump this water, laden with persistent
radioactive isotopes, into our food web.

Id like to encourage more collaboration between our excellent scientific minds at CAL and those in Japan to find
enduring solutions to cleaning up water contaminated by human activities around the world. Water, and fresh drinking
water in particular, is a finite resource. Why not put all best efforts into developing methods to separate and sequester
contaminates from water such that it can be returned to the environment without causing damage to wildlife and
human health?

Thanks for your time and attention

Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council,

Western States Legal Foundation, based in Oakland, is a nonprofit, tax- exempt organization
established in 1982 to provide legal support for nonviolent protesters challenging the construction of
the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. While our efforts over the years have focused primarily on
advocacy for the elimination of nuclear weapons, we remain firmly opposed to nuclear power for
many reasons. The ongoing dire situation at Fukushima Daiichi is one of them.

We write in support of Council member Kate Harrison’s “Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric.
Power Company and the Government of Japan’s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.”""'!

The Japanese Government and TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) are planning to discharge’
over |.3 million tons of treated water from the Advanced Liquid Processing System stored in tanks on
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant site into the Pacific Ocean for more than 40 years, starting
as soon as this summer. As a result, dangerous radionuclides could flow across the ocean to Russia,
Alaska, Canada, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. »

There is no precedent in Japan or any other country for a “disposal method” such as “treating” a large
amount of radioactively contaminated water generated from contact with molten fuel debris at a
nuclear reactor after a severe accident. There is no previous experience in diluting such water with an
even more enormous amount of seawater, then systematically releasing it into the ocean over several
decades. This treated water will contain more than 60 radionuclides, including carbon-14, cesium-137
and strontium-90, which the Advanced Liquid Processing System cannot altogether remove.

----
Intentionally discharging radioactive water into the ocean is contrary to the intent of the London
Convention and London Protocol, to which Japan is a party.!""! Such a discharge also violates the human
rights of people not only in Japan but also in many other countries that share the Pacific Ocean. UN |
Special Rapporteurs have expressed concern that this decision could threaten human health and the
environment. ltt! :

- The Pacific Islands Forum, a regional bloc of 18 island nations, has raised concerns about the release of
the radioactively contaminated water, including its impact on fisheries. Just today, at a meeting held in
the Cook Islands between Pacific Island leaders and the Director General of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown told the participants that the
Pacific's nuclear testing legacy continues to affect its people and ocean, eight decades on.!! The
dumping of massive quantities of radioactive water into the ocean would add insult to injury.

In December 2022, the U.S. National Association of Marine Laboratories, an association of over 100
laboratories, issued a Position Paper titled, “Scientific opposition to Japan’s planned release of over 1.3
million tons of radioactively contaminated water from the Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
disaster into the Pacific Ocean.” The statement begins: :

“The National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML), an organization of more than 100 member
laboratories, opposes Japan’s plans to begin releasing-over 1.3 million tons of radioactively
contaminated water from the Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean -
commencing in 2023. This opposition is based on the fact that there is a lack of adequate and accurate
_ scientific data supporting Japan’s assertion of safety. Furthermore, there is an abundance of data
demonstrating serious concerns about releasing radioactively contaminated water.” |

The statement concludes with a rational, scientifically responsible recommendation:

“We urge the Government of Japan to stop pursuing their planned and precedent-setting release of the
radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean and to work with the broader scientific
community to pursue other approaches that protect ocean life; human health; and those communities

who depend on ecologically, economically, and culturally valuable marine resources.”™!

We agree with this recommendation and urge the Berkeley City Council to go on record against
Japan’s planned release of radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council,

| hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. | am writing to express my deep concern and strong
opposition to the proposed release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific
Ocean. As a concerned citizen of Berkeley, | believe it is crucial for our city to take a stand against this decision and
protect the health and environment of our coastal waters. .

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as you are aware, experienced a catastrophic meltdown following the 2011
earthquake and tsunami. The resulting contamination of water in the plant's storage tanks has posed an ongoing.
challenge for the Japanese government. However, | firmly believe that releasing this contaminated water into the ocean
will have severe health and environmental consequences, not only for Japan but also for coastal regions as far away as
California. ) :

First and foremost, the release of contaminated water into the ocean poses significant health risks to marine life and
human populations. Radioactive isotopes such as tritium, cesium, and strontium are known to accumulate in seafood,
which could eventually find its way into our food chain. Studies have shown that exposure to these isotopes can lead to
various health issues, including an increased risk of cancer, genetic mutations, and developmental abnormalities.

Furthermore, the marine ecosystem in the California coastal waters, which is already vulnerable to numerous
environmental threats, would be significantly impacted by the release of contaminated water. The potential ecological
damage cannot be underestimated, as radioactive isotopes could harm marine organisms, disrupt the delicate balance
of ecosystems, and have far-reaching consequences for the health of our oceans.

Safer alternatives exist, including safe storage and radioactive decay, bioremediation, and use of treated water to make
concrete for special applications (the latter option has been proposed by the Independent Expert Panel to the Pacific

Islands Forum. Their paper is available at https://cafethorium.whoi.edu/concrete-option/).

As a city known for its commitment to environmental stewardship and public health, | urge the Berkeley City Council to
take a principled stance against the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. | kindly
request that the Council pass a resolution or issue a statement expressing our opposition to this proposal. | believe it is
our moral obligation to protect the well-being of our coastal waters, marine life, and the health of our community.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. | trust that you will carefully consider the potential risks and
ramifications of releasing contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Your decisive action would not
_ only safeguard our environment but also set an example for other communities to follow.

Dear Jesse Arreguin, Kate Harrison, Rashi Kesarwani, Terry Taplin, Ben Bartlett, Sophie Hahn, Susan Wengraf, Rigel

Robinson, and Mark Humbert,

| hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out to express my enthusiastic support for Councilmember Kate Harrison's
decision to include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan's Planned
Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on today's agenda at
the California Berkeley City Council.

As a concerned citizen who deeply values representatives who prioritize our planet's well-being, | believe it's crucial for
us to stand united on this important matter. Tokyo Electric Power Company recently made public its intention to release
radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This announcement has sparked global concern and
mobilized various groups worldwide to voice their apprehensions regarding the preservation of our precious oceans.

Numerous countries, such as Korea and Pacific Islands nations, along with countless institutions, global NGOs, and
dedicated fishers, have taken it upon themselves to raise awareness, explore alternative solutions, and pursue political
avenues to safeguard our marine ecosystems. Against this backdrop, the California Berkeley City Council will soon vote
on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of
Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.

| implore each of you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences that will be shared during the Council
meeting, as they hold the potential to shape a brighter future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among
other esteemed organizations, will provide valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making.

Considering the gravity of the situation, | wholeheartedly recommend that the California Berkeley City Council embraces
the Resolution opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan's proposed release of
wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | propose that copies
of this resolution be sent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative

- Barbara Lee to raise awareness and garner support at the federal level.

It is of utmost importance to consider the context surrounding this issue. Back in 2015, radioactive contamination from
the Fukushima disaster reached California's shores, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO's
plan to discharge additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as early as Spring of 2023. This planned release raises
serious concerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has
been undertaken to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts argue that TEPCO and the government of
Japan are proceeding without a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks involved.

While TEPCO and the government of Japan maintain that the wastewater has been adequately treated and poses no
environmental or health risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Marine biologists, marine pollution experts,
and scientists have highlighted significant deficiencies in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the
effectiveness of the ""Advanced Liquid Processing System"" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site.
Regrettably, this system falls short in its ability to remove all radioactive materials before releasing the wastewater.

1

----
Furthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights
Council expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives
and livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the substantial risks this poses to global environmental and
human rights. .

It's worth mentioning that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the
government of Japan's intended discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By aligning
with the City of West Hollywood and joining the ranks of tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of
Berkeley can reassert its position as a leading global environmental advocate, fully committed to preserving our planet's
invaluable resources. .

In conclusion, | implore each of you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison's initiative and take a firm stance against
the planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By
adopting the proposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can showcase its unwavering dedication to
environmental stewardship and send a resounding message to decision-makers at all levels.

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will conscientiously weigh the scientific evidence,
environmental implications, and concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please do not hesitate to
reach out if there's any additional information or support | can provide.

Yours sincerely,

- Dear Berkeley City Council Members and the Honorable Mayor Arreguin

| am writing this comment as a long time South Berkeley homeowner. Since my family has lived
in Berkeley we have seen the our neighborhood change from a lovable working class neighborhood
to an area so upscale as the homes are over a million dollars, that the neighborhood has no more
children. Because working people with children can’t afford it. We are pained to be in the middle of
the mass displacement of the working class, low income, moderate income and Black and other
people of color being ejected from their home and out of Berkeley because of NO affordable options.
Between 2005 and 2019 Black Berkeley residents decreased by 21%, a higher rate than other ethnic
and low income groups. Given the over 75 year history of the Black community living in Berkeley it
hurts my heart to loose long many time neighbors and friends. With over 55% of rented households
are rent burdened by 2019 statistics and 74% ot Black Berkery residents are renters. What has
happen to our town?

The Affordable Housing Preference Policy is a viable strategy to interrupt the unprecedented mass
displacement of Black, Brown, working class, low wage.and very low income citizens. The policy will
center and prioritize the needs of Berkeley’s most vulnerable and displaced community members.
The Berkeley | moved into over 35 years ago was a City that practiced and professed to believe
housing was a human right and its citizens deserved a City that respected their humanity not being
treated as a commodity. .

Re: Restore Strawberry Creek! Item #33 - Civic Center Phase II - Design Concept Adoption

‘Dear Honorable Mayor & City Council Members,

Our organization has been working to restore habitat by planting pollinator gardens in Berkeley Parks including Strawberry Creek
Park. From our work in the park, we have witnessed first hand how the daylighted section of Strawberry Creek brings about so
much vibrancy and life to the park and community. Children gleefully flock to it, while parents relax and picnic nearby. Birds flutter.

Daylighting creeks can offer transformational change to urban areas (2) and is a direct way to connect with nature, supports
biodiversity, honors indigenous land and rights of nature (3), offers educational opportunities, can bring in revitalization and
revenue, to name a few of the many benefits.

‘N
On July 11, 2023 you will have the opportunity to consider the approval of the Civic Center Plan.

The daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park is one of the most important elements of the Plan that we are asking you
to fully support.

We ask that the proposed Design for the creek not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the creek at this early stage
in the planning process. The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an ""alternate scenario"" using
the term “partial flow creek bed”.

A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what’s possible and would be more likely to secure funding.

Therefore, Transition Berkeley asks you to change the description of the ""alternate design"", from just a ""partial flow"" to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. We believe It can be done while still supporting the other important
park uses and activities.

We’ve experienced the success of daylighting the creek in Strawberry Creek Park and know that many other cities have enjoyed the
benefits of daylighting creeks in their downtown urban settings (2).

Let’s stay open to the possibility of daylighting the creek in Civic Center Park, while allowing full planning and design studies to
proceed.

Dear Mayor and Council,

I've spent considerable time out in our city parks over the last few weeks and this is what | heard from children
-and their parents. First of all Strawberry Creek Park was the most popular and most highly utilized of the parks
visited. Children love the creek. Their parents told me how their children want to come to the creek to play.
And play they did. .

| was surprised with the number of people from neighboring cities who visit Berkeley City Parks and again,
visitors from other cities, chose Strawberry Creek in much higher numbers. Besides the creek and play area,
the cafe was a big draw for visitors.

My experience of observing and listening matched the reports, studies and articles, | found online under the
search ""community impact of daylighting creeks"". Daylighting creeks has an enormously positive impact on
attracting people, especially families with children. More than that daylighting creeks brings economic
benefits, restores habitat and ecosystems, and is listed under actions for resilient cities,

Please support the alternative design and change the ' ‘partial flow"" to support a full flow restoration of
Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park.

Dear Mayor Arreguin and Members of the City Council,

Volunteers at Restore Strawberry Creek! polled Berkeley residents and park users and found
overwhelming enthusiasm for daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. Please take a
moment to review the responses and comments to see just how excited people are about
opening up the creek in the heart of the City.

And as a reminder, Restore Strawberry Creek! is actively seeking the funding necessary to
make the daylighting a reality and ask for a simple, but formal, acknowledgement that the Plan
would allow for a “full flow” restoration of Strawberry Creek. As we have demonstrated in
previous correspondence, a full flow restoration would allow for many, if not most, activities
considered in the Plan. Describing the daylighted creek as a “partial flow” restoration as the
Plan now states, could hamper our ability to attract state funding.

Sincerely,

Tom Kelly

| have contacted my City Council multiple times to fully support the restoration of Strawberry Creek and all
water flowing from the Berkeley Hills to the Bay. Clean water being filtered by sunlight will make humans, fish
and other wildlife migrating down the corridors healthier and, hopefully, happier. Full flow restoration makes _
sense. Do this work completely and well.

Council July 11 Item #33

Attachments: _ Strawberry Creek Paper Petition Responses 1-247.pdf

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.

Dear Honorable Mayor and Berkeley Councilmembers,

The support for daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park is strong. Please see the attached 247
signatures asking the Berkeley City Council to:

""SU pport a full exploration of daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park""

Limiting the creek to just a ""partial flow"" could interfere with grant opportunities. We ask that language be
added in the Motion tonight to allow for a full exploration of restoring the creek, to include a potential “full

flow design”. Please help us identify a design that can support the many important current (and future) uses
of the park while also adding the magic and appeal of a real, natural creek.

Youth love the idea of the creek! And so do parents!

Subject: Two things: Auditors Report and Civic Center Park

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the
~ sender and know the content is safe.

Dear Mayor Arreguin and Berkeley City Council Members,

First, Berkeley Auditor Jenny Wong has produced a first rate report on issues around Berkeley
City Staff and the implementation and non - completion of mandated recommendations.

| hope that the Mayor and Council will become more pro-active in holding the City Manager to an
implementation and reporting schedule.

Second, in response to the consultant report on Civic Center Park, | need to, once again, convey
my disappointment and distress.

1. The Report simply does not engage the costs of renovation of either the Maudelle
Shirek Old City Hall or the Veterans Building. It has been reasonably established that these costs
could run upward of $80 million.

Is the City Council, given all the other infrastructure issues in BEER y prepared to go
ahead with this proposed expenditure?

2. The Report simply does not make an argument for building a new City Council Chamber
in the Civic Center. It does not even pretend to do a “cost/benefit” analysis as to why it is necessary
or appropriate to move the Council meeting from their current location in the BUSD facility.

3. There is a proposal for daylighting a portion of Strawberry Creek through the Park, but
no assessment of either the current condition of the culvert OR the effect of splitting the park in two
by virtue of the daylighting.

In short, there are all sorts of recommendations but these recommendations are indifferent to
costs and vague in presumed benefits.

My view is that Civic Center Park is “underused” except for special-occasions because of its
location and surroundings. But that’s a different discussion.

The consultant report is profoundly dishonest and disingenuous. Please scrap it.

Subject: Item 35 and Psilocybin: A suicide attempt following psilocybin ingestion in a patient

with no prior psychiatric history

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.
Dear Mayor and Council,

Psilocybin is not an FDA-approved substance. Therefore, there is no Safety or Efficacy profile of the drug.

However, suicidal ieee and suicidal attempts have been reported in the literature. Including this report from June
2023.

There are many other serious safety signals associated with psilocybin that have been reported in the literature as
well. Are you going to warn people with epilepsy or who are on antidepressants not to use it? How about those with

heart disease? If you don't, you might be liable.

You are embarking ona very dangerous path if you deprioritize the enforcement of laws for psilocybin. Several of you
are attorneys and should know better. None of you have any medical training to speak of.

How many more psychiatrically unstable people do we need walking our streets?

Isabelle Gaston

COUNCIL MEETING OF:

JUL 1120233 196
From Eid: OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK

y CITY OF BERKELEY
es Mayor we applied as soon as Dionne Early posted the space few month ago, but beside that
we have applied for the lease in August 2020 when you offered the space as a lease pending a
license, next day after that Liam Garland called me at 9 AM, telling me he was getting the place
ready for us, and he will have Dionne Early prepare the paperwork next day you called me, and
seemed upset about Dionne Early objection, Liam Garland called me as well and asked to meet
Dionne and sweet talk her, | talked to her on the phone several times, expressing the urgency
of our situation as our current building was in the proccess of being demolished, , we had
several talks on the phone, the last time when she came by our old location at 2556 Telegraph
avenunue, again | had hard time convincinng her of the uregency of our situation, we then had
very large inventory, as well as dozens of display cabinets and fixtures, in fact while Dionne
Early were talking the demolition workers began demolishing the roof, above our head and big
chunks of the roof fell all around us, | stood up quickly and held Dionne by her hand and both of
us as well as my employees ran out of the store to street..... That was very. scary and dangerous
situation, | believe that the developer Aaran Keifer told the demolishers to start to tear the
building down even though he knew we were still inside, we lost over ten thousands dollars of
damage products, including Televisions and other electronics merchandise.......Aran Kiefer talk
to you couple of times, but his action on our final days at 2556 Telegraph was wrong......As far
as the application we have excellent credit and we have been in business over 50 years as |
established the business on May 1973 while | was full time graduate student at U C Berkeley
Nuclear Engineering department, by 1978 when | finished my PHD, Eids Television annual gross
sales exceeded 12 million dollars, | did continue my academic life by teaching at Cal for several
years and over one decade at National University in Cupertino, now it is located in San

Jose..... Thank you mayor Arreguin for responding | look forward for your call, and perhaps
meeting with you in person.any day next week,

Eid Telephone 510 848 5000.

Hi Eid - my apologies for the delay. | have been out of town. | am waiting for an update from
the Public Works Department on the vacant space in the Telegraph Channing Mall. My
understanding is that you applied correct? If so | want to find out the status of your application.
| am hoping to get an answer by tomorrow at which time | will call you. Thank you

Subject: Eid's TV

Dear Mayor Arreguin,

| moved to Berkeley in 1973 to attend the University of California and I've been here ever since because |
love this city and wouldn't want to live anywhere else.. Eid, who owns Eid's TV opened his electronics
business on North Shattuck around that same time, almost 50 years ago, and he's been in business in
Berkeley ever since.

As you know, Eid's is now located on Telegraph just below Dwight Way, and ! understand that the old
arcade that houses his store is going to be demolished and replaced by a modern building (a damned
shame) so Eid is compelled to find another place for his business or close up shop for good if he can't find a
suitable place in central Berkeley to relocate. | understand that retail space was found where Eid could
move his store, and the deal was all but consummated when a problem arose.

Eid's is a Berkeley institution and it would be a damned shame if he were driven out of business in his
beloved city because of some capricious reason. Berkeley is changing in many ways to keep up with the
zeitgeist of the 21st century and that is entirely understandable. But if this city gave in to crass
commercialism and took back the hand it had already extended to help a business that's been in Berkeley
for almost 50 years, that would not be the Berkeley | came to know and love and care about.

| entreat you to enable Eid to move his business to the new location that had been previously decided on.
Yours truly,

Jane Phillips

1501 Blake Street, No. 317

j.j. Phillips <jennyhanniver@hotmail.com>

Hello, Eid,

You don't know me but | pass by your store frequently, on my way to and from the dispensary down the
street. | also hear you when you call KGO to speak to Pat Thurston, John Rothmann, and the other hosts --
| also hear you when you call Michael Krasny on Forum and Minds Over Matter. | always enjoy your calls --

----
you invariably have some very interesting and important things to say. | was saddened to hear about the
troubles you're having with your store. It's a shame that the city is going to tear down that unique old
building and force you out, but | was encouraged when the other day you said that another place had been
found where you could move your business. But then you called John's show tonight and said that
someone had blocked the move, even though everybody else had approved it, and you asked people to
contact Jesse Arreguin to protest, so | sent him the email below and | hope the reasons why are evident in
the email.

| sincerely hope that whatever the problem is, it will be surmounted so that you can move your store and
stay in business here in Berkeley as long as you want.

Yours truly,
