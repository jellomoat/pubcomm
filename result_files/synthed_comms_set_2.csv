To Whom It May Concern,

lam Seaver Wang, Co-Director of the Climate and Energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, a US-based environmental

nonprofit research center located in Berkeley, California. It has recently come to our attention that Berkeley City
Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose

Japan’s planned discharge of objectively harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

As a Berkeley-based environmental research institution with staff possessing special expertise in oceanography and
nuclear power plant safety, we find this proposed resolution to be a senseless distraction for the city’s public agenda
that is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally counterproductive and harmful to social justice.

As we establish in our attached letter, the proposed release of water poses zero risk to public health and environmental
safety off the coast of Japan, and certainly for Berkeley residents and businesses. We show that a person drinking
nothing but the treated water for an entire year would experience a fraction of the equivalent of a chest X-ray
procedure. We emphasize that the International Atomic Energy Agency has determined in their final report, released
this week, that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent with relevant
international safety standards.”

We have attached our comment on Councilmember Harrison's proposed resolution to this email as a PDF document. —

Yours sincerely,

To: Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council
From: Dr. Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute

Subject: We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison's Symbolic and Non-Scientific Proposed Resolution
Criticizing the Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant.

Any visitor walking along Berkeley's sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after
house, in window after window: “In this house we believe science is real.” With Berkeley hosting one of the
nation’s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory, this communal respect for the
scientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody.

As such, we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new
resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan's planned discharge of objectively
harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Councilmember Harrison's resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated
water from the Fukushima facility. If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly
from the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) fora full year at the planned upper limit
concentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)’, their total added dose of radiation would be
0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)?,
and approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02
mSv).’ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health
Organization's threshold for tritium in drinking water.>

Dilution of the Fukushima release by a little over a factor of two would put the release well below the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold for tritium in water of 20,000 pCi/L. Needless to say, the vast
Pacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at
Fukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific
measurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring
background radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report
reviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy

_ Agency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent
with relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and I at the Breakthrough Institute would be
happy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that
the water is entirely safe. )

By the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation
process requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any
remaining additional radioactivity from the release. Clearly, Councilmember Kate Harrison's claim that the
release “could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region” and “imposes considerable
risks to environmental and human rights across the globe” amounts to nothing but sheer political theater.
The risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses"" is, quite literally, zero.

We further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to
quote represent explicitly anti-nuclear advocacy groups, including Greenpeace International, Friends of the
Earth, and No Nukes Action. These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained .
ideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against
climate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize
nuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison’s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically
rigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support
clean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources
in decarbonizing the global energy system.®

_ In response to Councilmember Harrison's invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear
misinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific

peoples because of the exaggerated discourse on the Fukushima water release issue. Anti-nuclear activists,
playing to radiation-related historical traumas and vastly inflating the public health and environmental
risks posed by the release, have inflicted and continue to inflict undue anxiety upon communities across
the Asia-Pacific, while threatening economic harm to the peoples of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki
Prefectures in Japan. These organizations would celebrate the shutdown of nuclear power stations across
Asia, even if this prolongs the continued operation of fossil fuel power plants that contribute to climate

change and would directly sicken more Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese people from.air pollution.

We strongly urge the other members of the Berkeley City Council to reject Councilmember Harrison's empty
resolution in the most forceful terms. And we rebuke Councilmember Harrison for occupying the city's
public agenda with a resolution that is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally
counterproductive and harmful to social justice.

Subject: Yes to Consent Item #29 - Oppose Discharge of Wamewater from Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Oceam

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or r attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is
safe.
Dear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council: ~

| am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley, to
urge you to adopt by consent the Resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the
Government of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into
the Pacific Ocean (Consent Item #29)” at tomorrow's Council meeting.

The government of Japan and TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) plan to soon begin dumping 1.3
million tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. Currents will bring it here and,
eventually, around the world. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from
Fukushima across the Pacific to California. Moreover, traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off
the coast of California since 2015. 70% of the water supposedly “treated” with the ALPS (Advanced Liquid
Processing System) which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for
discharge. Strontium-90, one of the radionuclides found in the “treated” water, is among the most hazardous
radionuclides; once in the body, Strontium-90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and
teeth, where it can cause the cancers of bone, bone marrow, and soft tissues around the bone. TEPCO’s
“safety” claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a
human body; once it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell
mutations. Because of TEPCO’s inadequate sampling practices, lack of data on what the water actually
contains, and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the
discharge, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.

The people ¢ of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea, China, the Philippines, as well as the Pacific -
Island nations, overwhelmingly oppose the dumping. The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of
international, independent, interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the
best solution, which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and, therefore, will have very
little contact with humans. While it may not be the perfect solution, the cement encasement is far safer than
dumping it in the ocean; the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released.

The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) which has approved the plan, has a contradictory dual
purpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time. For this
reason, the IAEA is often seen as biased. An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower
suggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from
the final report at the request of the Japanese government.

it is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future »
generations. | urge you to vote in support of the resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company |
and the Government of Japan’s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power

‘ Plant into the Pacific Ocean” at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th, on behalf of concerned
citizens like myself.

RE: Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park and Right-of-way Evaluation and Key
Considerations

Dear Councilmember Harrison;

L understand that a “required” right-of-way of 150’, taken from the 1999 Wolfe
Mason report, is being used to evaluate the potential for daylighting Strawberry
Creek at Civic Center Park. I am concerned that this value if far greater than what
might actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration, so I have
prepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating
the potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park.

The first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert
invert is 18’ below the surface. Based on this depth and empirical data of the
Strawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus, we prepared what I
would consider a minimal creek corridor width. I included typical stream bank
treatments such as armored “cut banks”, 2:1 slopes, small terracing walls, public
access paths, and a small amount of floodplain.

The exercise produced a 76’ right-of-way width. The second drawing was prepared
to show what that 76’ width would represent in plan-view when placed over Civic
Center Park. Together, these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie
depiction of a restored creek and right-of-way requirements.

I should add that the right-of-way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum
width but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to “fit” the restored
channel into the site and accommodate other park uses. It may also be appropriate
to widen the creek right-of-way in other locations to better integrate the resource
into the broader park program.

I believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language
that emphasizes the need for ""full restoration,"" and that allows for the consideration
of alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site. I hope that these
drawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the
evaluation of more specific design alternatives.

A full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of
Strawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would
conform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design.

Key points:

e Drawing A represents a minimum Right of Way (ROW) necessary to provide
significant ecological services associated with robust riparian ecosystems.

e Drawing B represents - and shows - the minimum ROW required in a plan
view for informational and discussion purposes, but does xof represent a
specific design plan.

¢ Specific design plans and alternatives would be developed in a fully public,
transparent planning and design process, which would incorporate the
ecological requirements of a restored riparian corridor, as well as the adjacent
conditions related to Civic Center Park, and the input of the community's
many stakeholders.

e The grant program under which California Urban Streams Partnership
(CUSP) has been selected to submit a full grant application, specifically
builds in this public process as part of the grant parameters. Thus, design
and planning alternatives - and the process through which these are
developed - would be funded under this grant, if CUSP and the City were to
receive it.

I hope that this is helpful to the City’s planning Process and please don’t hesitate to
contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

WARNING: This is not a City of Berkeley email. Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the

Dear Council:

We at the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum (BHSM) are pleased that the Civic Center
planning has moved along this far, and we want to encourage you to vote to proceed. to the next
phase. It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to
serve its mission: to foster appreciation and understanding of our city’s unique history by residents
and visitors alike through research, collection, preservation, exhibition and publication of historical
records, photographs, artifacts and other media. ;

Although a first-floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence, there are
advantages to the current plan, which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall
space for exhibits on the other levels. We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take
place first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut
down. We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes, furnishings and
-equipment for BHSM spaces.

As you may know, the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with
Berkeley’s centennial. (There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City
Hall and the Acheson Building, and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City
Hall.) We are now approaching the Society’s 50th anniversary and the city’s sesquicentennial in
2028. Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building. It is thirty years
this month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993, and it seems the building has received
minimal maintenance by the City since then. The main floor is overheated in the winter, the second
floor has no heat, and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition.

The Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained; for example, peeling paint on its exterior
woodwork will cause further damage. While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and
renovations to take place at some point in the future, we hope the City staff can find a way to attend
to some of these two buildings’ sore needs in the meantime.

For several years we have been sending each of you our + quarterly newsletter containing articles .
about Berkeley history. (If you would like it to go to your home address, please let me know.) We
hope you have been able to read at least some issues and visit some of our exhibits and events. We
also encourage you to explore our new website, berkhistory.org.

~ We look forward to working in partnership with the City and the Community for a Cultural Civic Center
on bringing an exciting new vision for ine Civic Center complex into reality. Please feel free to contact
me if you have any questions.

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council Members,

_-On July 11 please support the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park in the Civic Center Plan.

The Civic Center Design Concept describes the daylighting of the Creek with an “alternate scenario"" using
the term “partial flow creek bed”. The proposed Design for the creek should not assume any limitations on
the location and flow of the creek. A full planning and design study would give the Council a better sense of
what's possible and would be more likely to secure funding.

Therefore, please change the description of the ""alternate design"" from just a ""partial flow"" to supporting a
full flow restoration of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. This can be done while still supporting the
other important park uses and activities.

RE: Civic Center Plan, July 11 Consent calendar item #33

The Civic Center Plan is excellent and should be accepted with one addendum: the condition of the Strawberry Creek
- culvert has not been sufficiently explored including the options of what to do with this aging infrastructure that runs
under the Maudelle Shirek Building (Old City Hall). There are at least three maps that show its course, and they are
attached. In the Plan, the map is on page 107.

Since Old City Hall was built in 1909, the concrete composing the 9 foot in diameter culvert would be at least that old,
and has already failed in several places, as the City map attached shows. Rebuilding on top of this ancient aqueduct is

unthinkable given the potential for extreme downpours and flooding due to climate change.

No thought has been given in this plan to the options for reinforcing or rerouting the culvert north of the Shirek Building
between it and the public safety building and the costs involved.

Any consideration of a water feature such as partial daylighting of the creek is premature and should wait on the
- recommendations of a study of the culvert’s condition and available options. )

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Council,

On July 11, 2023 you will be considering the approval of the Civic Center Plan. One of the most
important elements of the Plan is the daylighting of Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park. | ask for
your full support.

I’ve lived in Berkeley most of my life. As a child, | loved visiting Live Oak Park with its creek. Now | love
visiting Strawberry Creek Park, looking at the creek bouncing over the stones and watching the children
enjoy themselves there. We all need nature for our mental health—birds, creeks, trees. | would love to
see a fully daylighted creek downtown.

The Civic Center Plan describes the daylighting of the Creek as an ""alternate scenario"" with just a
“partial restoration”. | ask that the Plan not assume any limitations on the location and flow of the
‘Creek. A full planning and design study would give you a better sense of what’s possible and would be
more likely to secure funding. Therefore, | ask you to change the description of the ""alternate plan"",
from just a “partial flow"" to this: “Alternate plan with a daylighted Strawberry Creek, design and flow

to be determined thru future study.”
Thank you,

Nancy Schimmel

July 10, 2023

To: City Council

From: Chairperson Enchill on behalf of the Landmarks Preservation  oninission (LPC) -
Vote: 8-0-0-1

Regarding: Berkeley Civic Center Planning

Members of the City Council:

The Landmarks Preservation Commission has watched with interest, periodic
participation, and encouragement the lengthy planning process for renovation of
Berkeley’s Civic Center. By and large, from a preservation standpoint, the process has’
worked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to
historic issues. We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on
next steps. The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically:

1.

Calls for and supports, as a general principle, the restoration, refurbishment, and
sensitive adaptive re-use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and
the park, rather than their radical replacement, demolition, or alteration;

supports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives
connected to the Civic Center (including the LPC, Civic Arts, Parks & Waterfront,
Disability, and Transportation / Public Works). The ongoing subcommittee has been,
and should remain, a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues,
interact with staff, consultants, and the public, and advise the Council on planning
proposals and projects for the Civic Center. The subcommittee can particularly serve
as a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024-2027 “research, schematic
design and approvals funding plan, design development” phase;

supports, and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with
further planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek
Building and the Veterans Building, particularly funding for seismic
strengthening. There should be no substantial pause in planning. These are highly
important structures that are both historic and useful, and the City should make it a
high priority to bring both of them back into full use. Both buildings are currently living
on borrowed time, given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the
Bay Area;

Page 1 of 5

----
. supports full accessibility for the buildings, with a design approach that also
minimizes impacts / alterations to the main facades. If the zig-zag ramp on the
front of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned / modified or replaced use of the
State Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to
better harmonize with the historic front steps / facade;

. supports recommendations of the consultant / staff reports that emphasize .
restoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings, both inside and out,
including original finishes, details, and maintaining general historic interior
layout. The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through
adaptive design, as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors.
Use of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent
possible. .

. supports, in concept, the addition of infill structures placed behind the two
buildings to expand their useable square footage. Additions should be
designed and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
do not detract from, compete with, or alter the principal facades of the historic
buildings;

. supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to
one or both courtyards of the Veterans Building. Courtyard infill would
considerably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a
large number of simultaneous arts events and activities, and is also best
constructed in conjunction with overall building renovations. The courtyards are
near-ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have
an impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building;

. supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck / event space to the roof
_ of the Veterans Building, so long as it is designed in such a way that it is
concealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic
facade, especially when seen from across the park;

. supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses, including
performing arts and visual arts. Supports the broadest possible access of arts
and community groups to the building, rather than exclusive or extensive use of
the building for / by a small number of groups / organizations;

hall) for City and civic meeting and educational use, including maximizing the
provision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes, so
several meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building,
and so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual
and in-person participation;

. supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley

Community Media and the Berkeley Historical Society & Museum (BHSM).
Both uses are compatible with the history / use of the building. Berkeley
Community Media also provides support for civic meetings (such as broadcast of
Council and Commission meetings), while BHSM’s proposed operation of a
museum and history research center would bring users to the building;

supports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city
programs interested in local history (such as the History Room in the Public
Library) to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a “one-stop” center
of local historical education, research, display, and archives;

supports, in particular, the preservation and re-use of specific key historic
spaces in both buildings including: within the Veterans Building, the fine
auditorium, and four lodge / meeting rooms, and extensive lobby; within the
Maudelle Shirek Building, the interior halls and grand staircase, and the
historic Council Chambers on the upper floor (the Council Chamber room is
currently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as |
Commissions that expect a considerable audience).

supports the creation of a new, large, multipurpose room addition to the rear of
the Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large
Commission meetings, as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use
and activities. The room should be designed flexibly without fixed / built-in seating
or furniture, so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses;

encourages consideration of moving Berkeley’s Visitor Center to the Shirek
Building to bring more users, tourists, and visitors to the Civic Center;

Pe.

encourages providing both buildings with ‘catering kitchens’ and support
infrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and
rental events such as receptions, social gatherings, and even meals / dinner events;

calls for, and supports creation of, a comprehensive interpretive signage and
website program that would educate the public about the history and
development of the Civic Center; |

opposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from
elsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building. This
would do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses / users,
and would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active
uses. In addition, an approach that emphasizes “more city staff offices” will simply
not resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to
future Civic Center renovations; discourages any pre-reservation or design of space
in the buildings for programs that do not currently exist;

notes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local
veterans organizations, which were large and active at the time it was built.
Permanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a
means for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have
ongoing and affordable access to meeting / event space in the Civic Center;

encourages the City to plan, renovate, and manage the Civic Center buildings
so they can be rented—when not in civic uses such as public meetings or
community arts events—for uses, both small and large, from concerts, festivals,
and fairs to meetings, conventions, and conferences. If effectively designed and
managed the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to
hold conferences and events, while also producing income for the City;

. encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so

the Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus, which is the
largest indoor theater space in Berkeley, can be restored and integrated into
Civic Center activities and use;

generally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green
spaces and existing trees, provides unobtrusive infrastructure (bathrooms, power

Page 4 of 5

----
sources, lighting, etc.) to support multiple uses, emphasizes not only event use, but
supports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users, reuses
rather than unnecessarily demolishes, existing hardscape, emphasizes the park as a
harmonious, historic, and generally symmetrical civic space, and brings water back
to the fountain; discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that
unnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future
functionality; :

23.Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non-historic parking lot
behind 2180 Milvia, at the east end of the park, and supports integration of this
area into the park space overall. A portion of this area could (as plans currently
propose) remain hardscape, not for daily parking, but for use as a Staging area for
larger events within the park;

24.supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large
gatherings, festivals, and similar events. Opposes construction of new
permanent structures (particularly buildings) in the park space, and encourages
event facilities to be designed unobtrusively (for example, it should be planned and
possible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park, but building big
outdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses /
users. The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages.)

25. Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center
(including memorial trees, and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the
buildings) be fully identified, maintained, and protected, particularly memorials
to veterans. Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained.

26. Reserves judgment on the possibility of “daylighting” Strawberry Creek within
the Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted.
The LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies / proposals for
daylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential
impact on the historic design and character of the park in particular. The LPC
encourages all, including the City and private groups, studying daylighting to
take into account two key issues: preserving the overall physical framework /
historic character / design of the Civic Center; ensuring ample and adequate access
for the public, especially for disabled t users, to the buildings and outdoor spaces of
the Civic Center.

Dear Berkeley City Council,

I’m grateful to you for hearing the matter to decriminalize (deprioritize) entheogenic plants and
fungi. |am a former English instructor at Berkeley City College (2001-2011), an Oakland Pen
‘award-winning poet and filmmaker who resides here in Berkeley. | am also a member of
Psychedelics in Recovery, a 12-step based fellowship whose members use psychedelics in their
personal work to recover from maladaptive behaviors, such as addiction. | am also a member in
good standing of Sacred Garden Community Church, an entheogenic church based in Oakland, CA.

| am asking for your support for this resolution on entheogenic plants and fungi, and for removal
of restrictions on sharing in the second resolved statement. In my church the sharing of —
sacraments is a sacred act, equivalent of the sharing of the Host in Christian churches, or the
sharing of the Seder plate in Judaism. This second resolved statement will complicate, if not
prohibit, that practice and infringe on our rights to practice our faith in the full freedom granted
to us under our Constitution. | therefore plead with you to remove that clause to allow our
members to.practice their faith without undue complications. :

Thank you for considering the decriminalization of these sacred plants and removing restrictions
on their use. Hundreds of thousands, and historically, millions, have found healing with these
sacred medicines, and your courage in allowing people to work with these plants as they feel need
will add to the growing movement to bring this unspeakably inhumane, infantilizing and |
destructive, even criminal, “War on Drugs” under which the country has suffered for far too long.

Sincerely,
Clifton Ross

Dear Mayor and Councilmembers:

| am writing to urge your support of Item #35 on the July 11 Agenda. This would eliminate criminal penalties for personal
use of entheogenic/psychedelic plants and fungi.

Criminalizing these substances since the 1970s hasn't diminished their prevalence. Rather, criminalization has
marginalized these substances socially, encouraging their abuse and associated personal and social costs.

By eliminating criminal penalties for personal use of psychedelic plants and fungi, you promote a culture ‘of responsible
use and you reduce the need for expensive governmental drug enforcement.

Please do the right thing and support Item #35 next Tuesday.
Sincerely,

Karen Armstead
