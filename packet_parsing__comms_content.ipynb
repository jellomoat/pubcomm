It has recently come to our attention that Berkeley City\\nCouncilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose\\n\\nJapan’s planned discharge of objectively harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nAs a Berkeley-based environmental research institution with staff possessing special expertise in oceanography and\\nnuclear power plant safety, we find this proposed resolution to be a senseless distraction for the city’s public agenda\\nthat is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally counterproductive and harmful to social justice.\\n\\nAs we establish in our attached letter, the proposed release of water poses zero risk to public health and environmental\\nsafety off the coast of Japan, and certainly for Berkeley residents and businesses. We show that a person drinking\\nnothing but the treated water for an entire year would experience a fraction of the equivalent of a chest X-ray\\nprocedure. We emphasize that the International Atomic Energy Agency has determined in their final report, released\\nthis week, that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent with relevant\\ninternational safety standards.”\\n\\nWe have attached our comment on Councilmember Harrison\\'s proposed resolution to this email as a PDF document. —\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nSeaver Wang\\n\\nSeaver Wang, Ph.D. (he/him) J\\nCo-Director, Climate and Energy Program\\n\\nThe Breakthrough Institute\\n\\nseaver@thebreakthrough.org\\n\\nTwitter: @wang seaver\\n\\n\\n----\\nBREA THROUGH\\n\\nINSTITU\\nJuly 06, 2023\\nTo: Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council\\nFrom: Dr. Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute\\n\\nSubject: We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison\\'s Symbolic and Non-Scientific Proposed Resolution\\nCriticizing the Government of Japan\\'s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi\\nNuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nAny visitor walking along Berkeley\\'s sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after\\nhouse, in window after window: “In this house we believe science is real.” With Berkeley hosting one of the\\nnation’s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory, this communal respect for the\\nscientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody.\\n\\nAs such, we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new\\nresolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan\\'s planned discharge of objectively\\nharmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nCouncilmember Harrison\\'s resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated\\nwater from the Fukushima facility. If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly\\nfrom the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) fora full year at the planned upper limit\\nconcentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)’, their total added dose of radiation would be\\n0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)?,\\nand approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02\\nmSv).’ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health\\nOrganization\\'s threshold for tritium in drinking water.>\\n\\n1 International Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Review of Safety Related Aspects of Handling ALPS-Treated Water at\\nTEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station: Report 5: Review Mission to NRA.” 2023.\\n\\n* 730.5 liters x 1500 Bq/L x 1.8E-11 Sv/Bq (dose coefficient for tritium, in Sv/Bq, from Radiological Aspects.

Needless to say, the vast\\nPacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at\\nFukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific\\nmeasurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring\\nbackground radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report\\nreviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy\\n\\n_ Agency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent\\nwith relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and I at the Breakthrough Institute would be\\nhappy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that\\nthe water is entirely safe. )\\n\\nBy the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation\\nprocess requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any\\nremaining additional radioactivity from the release. Clearly, Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s claim that the\\nrelease “could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region” and “imposes considerable\\nrisks to environmental and human rights across the globe” amounts to nothing but sheer political theater.\\nThe risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses\" is, quite literally, zero.\\n\\nWe further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to\\nquote represent explicitly anti-nuclear advocacy groups, including Greenpeace International, Friends of the\\nEarth, and No Nukes Action. These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained .\\nideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against\\nclimate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize\\nnuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison’s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically\\nrigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support\\nclean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources\\nin decarbonizing the global energy system.®\\n\\n_ In response to Councilmember Harrison\\'s invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear\\nmisinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific\\n\\n6 international Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Finds Japan’s Plans to Release Treated Water into the Sea at\\nFukushima Consistent with International Safety Standards.” July 4, 2023. °\\nhttps://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-finds-japans-plans-to-release-treated-water-into-the-sea-at-\\nfukushima-consistent-with-international-safety-standards.

Do not click links or r attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is\\nsafe.\\nDear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council: ~\\n\\n| am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley, to\\nurge you to adopt by consent the Resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the\\nGovernment of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into\\nthe Pacific Ocean (Consent Item #29)” at tomorrow's Council meeting.\\n\\nThe government of Japan and TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) plan to soon begin dumping 1.3\\nmillion tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. Currents will bring it here and,\\neventually, around the world. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from\\nFukushima across the Pacific to California. Moreover, traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off\\nthe coast of California since 2015. 70% of the water supposedly “treated” with the ALPS (Advanced Liquid\\nProcessing System) which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for\\ndischarge. Strontium-90, one of the radionuclides found in the “treated” water, is among the most hazardous\\nradionuclides; once in the body, Strontium-90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and\\nteeth, where it can cause the cancers of bone, bone marrow, and soft tissues around the bone. TEPCO’s\\n“safety” claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a\\nhuman body; once it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell\\nmutations. Because of TEPCO’s inadequate sampling practices, lack of data on what the water actually\\ncontains, and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the\\ndischarge, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of\\nHawaii at Manoa, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.\\n\\nThe people ¢ of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea, China, the Philippines, as well as the Pacific -\\nIsland nations, overwhelmingly oppose the dumping. The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of\\ninternational, independent, interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the\\nbest solution, which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and, therefore, will have very\\nlittle contact with humans. While it may not be the perfect solution, the cement encasement is far safer than\\ndumping it in the ocean; the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released.\\n\\nThe IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) which has approved the plan, has a contradictory dual\\npurpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time. For this\\nreason, the IAEA is often seen as biased. An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower\\nsuggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from\\nthe final report at the request of the Japanese government.\\n\\nit is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future »\\ngenerations. | urge you to vote in support of the resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company |\\nand the Government of Japan’s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power\\n\\n‘ Plant into the Pacific Ocean” at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th, on behalf of concerned\\ncitizens like myself.\\n\\n----\\nThank you to Council Member Harrison for being the author on the consent item.\\nSincerely,\\nMiya Sommers\\n\\nMiya Sommers\\nmiyasommers@gmail.com\"}\n",

I am concerned that this value if far greater than what\\nmight actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration, so I have\\nprepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating\\nthe potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park.\\n\\nThe first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert\\ninvert is 18’ below the surface. Based on this depth and empirical data of the\\nStrawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus, we prepared what I\\nwould consider a minimal creek corridor width. I included typical stream bank\\ntreatments such as armored “cut banks”, 2:1 slopes, small terracing walls, public\\naccess paths, and a small amount of floodplain.\\n\\nThe exercise produced a 76’ right-of-way width. The second drawing was prepared\\nto show what that 76’ width would represent in plan-view when placed over Civic\\nCenter Park. Together, these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie\\ndepiction of a restored creek and right-of-way requirements.\\n\\nI should add that the right-of-way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum\\nwidth but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to “fit” the restored\\nchannel into the site and accommodate other park uses. It may also be appropriate\\nto widen the creek right-of-way in other locations to better integrate the resource\\ninto the broader park program.\\n\\nI believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language\\nthat emphasizes the need for \"full restoration,\" and that allows for the consideration\\nof alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site. I hope that these\\ndrawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the\\nevaluation of more specific design alternatives.\\n\\nA full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of\\nStrawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would\\nconform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design.\\n\\n----\\nDrawing A Conceptual Section: Note that this drawing is only partially illustrated,\\nand a restored creek would have native vegetation on both banks.\\n\\nCONCEPTUAL SECTION. 06 July, 2023\\nSTRAWBERRY CREEK | City of Berkeley Restoration Design Group, Inc.\\n\\nDrawing B. Right-of-way Diagram illustrating a 76’ wide creek corridor. This is for\\n\\nplanning purposes only and does not consider other park and city land uses.\\nes < 7 SUZ ITS 2 RSE eatery\\n\\n\\n----\\nKey points:\\n\\ne Drawing A represents a minimum Right of Way (ROW) necessary to provide\\nsignificant ecological services associated with robust riparian ecosystems.\\n\\ne Drawing B represents - and shows - the minimum ROW required in a plan\\nview for informational and discussion purposes, but does xof represent a\\nspecific design plan.\\n\\n¢ Specific design plans and alternatives would be developed in a fully public,\\ntransparent planning and design process, which would incorporate the\\necological requirements of a restored riparian corridor, as well as the adjacent\\nconditions related to Civic Center Park, and the input of the community\\'s\\nmany stakeholders.\\n\\ne The grant program under which California Urban Streams Partnership\\n(CUSP) has been selected to submit a full grant application, specifically\\nbuilds in this public process as part of the grant parameters. Thus, design\\nand planning alternatives - and the process through which these are\\ndeveloped - would be funded under this grant, if CUSP and the City were to\\nreceive it.\\n\\nI hope that this is helpful to the City’s planning Process and please don’t hesitate to\\ncontact me if you have any questions.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n- Drew Goetting\\nPrincipal'}\n",

It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to\\nserve its mission: to foster appreciation and understanding of our city’s unique history by residents\\nand visitors alike through research, collection, preservation, exhibition and publication of historical\\nrecords, photographs, artifacts and other media. ;\\n\\nAlthough a first-floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence, there are\\nadvantages to the current plan, which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall\\nspace for exhibits on the other levels. We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take\\nplace first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut\\ndown. We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes, furnishings and\\n-equipment for BHSM spaces.\\n\\nAs you may know, the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with\\nBerkeley’s centennial. (There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City\\nHall and the Acheson Building, and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City\\nHall.) We are now approaching the Society’s 50th anniversary and the city’s sesquicentennial in\\n2028. Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building. It is thirty years\\nthis month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993, and it seems the building has received\\nminimal maintenance by the City since then. The main floor is overheated in the winter, the second\\nfloor has no heat, and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition.\\n\\nThe Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained; for example, peeling paint on its exterior\\nwoodwork will cause further damage. While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and\\nrenovations to take place at some point in the future, we hope the City staff can find a way to attend\\nto some of these two buildings’ sore needs in the meantime.\\n\\nFor several years we have been sending each of you our + quarterly newsletter containing articles .\\nabout Berkeley history.

By and large, from a preservation standpoint, the process has’\\nworked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to\\nhistoric issues. We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on\\nnext steps. The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nCalls for and supports, as a general principle, the restoration, refurbishment, and\\nsensitive adaptive re-use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and\\nthe park, rather than their radical replacement, demolition, or alteration;\\n\\nsupports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives\\nconnected to the Civic Center (including the LPC, Civic Arts, Parks & Waterfront,\\nDisability, and Transportation / Public Works). The ongoing subcommittee has been,\\nand should remain, a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues,\\ninteract with staff, consultants, and the public, and advise the Council on planning\\nproposals and projects for the Civic Center. The subcommittee can particularly serve\\nas a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024-2027 “research, schematic\\ndesign and approvals funding plan, design development” phase;\\n\\nsupports, and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with\\nfurther planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek\\nBuilding and the Veterans Building, particularly funding for seismic\\nstrengthening. There should be no substantial pause in planning. These are highly\\nimportant structures that are both historic and useful, and the City should make it a\\nhigh priority to bring both of them back into full use. Both buildings are currently living\\non borrowed time, given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the\\nBay Area;\\n\\nPage 1 of 5\\n\\n----\\n. supports full accessibility for the buildings, with a design approach that also\\nminimizes impacts / alterations to the main facades. If the zig-zag ramp on the\\nfront of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned / modified or replaced use of the\\nState Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to\\nbetter harmonize with the historic front steps / facade;\\n\\n. supports recommendations of the consultant / staff reports that emphasize .\\nrestoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings, both inside and out,\\nincluding original finishes, details, and maintaining general historic interior\\nlayout. The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through\\nadaptive design, as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors.\\nUse of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent\\npossible. .\\n\\n. supports, in concept, the addition of infill structures placed behind the two\\nbuildings to expand their useable square footage. Additions should be\\ndesigned and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and\\ndo not detract from, compete with, or alter the principal facades of the historic\\nbuildings;\\n\\n. supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to\\none or both courtyards of the Veterans Building. Courtyard infill would\\nconsiderably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a\\nlarge number of simultaneous arts events and activities, and is also best\\nconstructed in conjunction with overall building renovations. The courtyards are\\nnear-ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have\\nan impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building;\\n\\n. supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck / event space to the roof\\n_ of the Veterans Building, so long as it is designed in such a way that it is\\nconcealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic\\nfacade, especially when seen from across the park;\\n\\n. supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses, including\\nperforming arts and visual arts. Supports the broadest possible access of arts\\nand community groups to the building, rather than exclusive or extensive use of\\nthe building for / by a small number of groups / organizations;\\n\\nPage 2 of 5\\n\\n----\\n10. supports primary use of the Maudelle Shirek Building (Berkeley’s original town\\n\\n1\\n\\n—\\n\\n12.\\n\\n13.\\n\\n14.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nhall) for City and civic meeting and educational use, including maximizing the\\nprovision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes, so\\nseveral meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building,\\nand so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual\\nand in-person participation;\\n\\n. supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley\\n\\nCommunity Media and the Berkeley Historical Society & Museum (BHSM).\\nBoth uses are compatible with the history / use of the building. Berkeley\\nCommunity Media also provides support for civic meetings (such as broadcast of\\nCouncil and Commission meetings), while BHSM’s proposed operation of a\\nmuseum and history research center would bring users to the building;\\n\\nsupports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city\\nprograms interested in local history (such as the History Room in the Public\\nLibrary) to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a “one-stop” center\\nof local historical education, research, display, and archives;\\n\\nsupports, in particular, the preservation and re-use of specific key historic\\nspaces in both buildings including: within the Veterans Building, the fine\\nauditorium, and four lodge / meeting rooms, and extensive lobby; within the\\nMaudelle Shirek Building, the interior halls and grand staircase, and the\\nhistoric Council Chambers on the upper floor (the Council Chamber room is\\ncurrently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as |\\nCommissions that expect a considerable audience).\\n\\nsupports the creation of a new, large, multipurpose room addition to the rear of\\nthe Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large\\nCommission meetings, as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use\\nand activities. The room should be designed flexibly without fixed / built-in seating\\nor furniture, so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses;\\n\\nencourages consideration of moving Berkeley’s Visitor Center to the Shirek\\nBuilding to bring more users, tourists, and visitors to the Civic Center;\\n\\nPage 3 of 5\\n\\n----\\n16.\\n\\n17.\\n\\n18.\\n\\n19.\\n\\n20.\\n\\n21\\n\\nPe.\\n\\nencourages providing both buildings with ‘catering kitchens’ and support\\ninfrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and\\nrental events such as receptions, social gatherings, and even meals / dinner events;\\n\\ncalls for, and supports creation of, a comprehensive interpretive signage and\\nwebsite program that would educate the public about the history and\\ndevelopment of the Civic Center; |\\n\\nopposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from\\nelsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building. This\\nwould do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses / users,\\nand would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active\\nuses. In addition, an approach that emphasizes “more city staff offices” will simply\\nnot resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to\\nfuture Civic Center renovations; discourages any pre-reservation or design of space\\nin the buildings for programs that do not currently exist;\\n\\nnotes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local\\nveterans organizations, which were large and active at the time it was built.\\nPermanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a\\nmeans for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have\\nongoing and affordable access to meeting / event space in the Civic Center;\\n\\nencourages the City to plan, renovate, and manage the Civic Center buildings\\nso they can be rented—when not in civic uses such as public meetings or\\ncommunity arts events—for uses, both small and large, from concerts, festivals,\\nand fairs to meetings, conventions, and conferences. If effectively designed and\\nmanaged the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to\\nhold conferences and events, while also producing income for the City;\\n\\n. encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so\\n\\nthe Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus, which is the\\nlargest indoor theater space in Berkeley, can be restored and integrated into\\nCivic Center activities and use;\\n\\ngenerally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green\\nspaces and existing trees, provides unobtrusive infrastructure (bathrooms, power\\n\\nPage 4 of 5\\n\\n----\\nsources, lighting, etc.) to support multiple uses, emphasizes not only event use, but\\nsupports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users, reuses\\nrather than unnecessarily demolishes, existing hardscape, emphasizes the park as a\\nharmonious, historic, and generally symmetrical civic space, and brings water back\\nto the fountain; discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that\\nunnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future\\nfunctionality; :\\n\\n23.Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non-historic parking lot\\nbehind 2180 Milvia, at the east end of the park, and supports integration of this\\narea into the park space overall. A portion of this area could (as plans currently\\npropose) remain hardscape, not for daily parking, but for use as a Staging area for\\nlarger events within the park;\\n\\n24.supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large\\ngatherings, festivals, and similar events. Opposes construction of new\\npermanent structures (particularly buildings) in the park space, and encourages\\nevent facilities to be designed unobtrusively (for example, it should be planned and\\npossible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park, but building big\\noutdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses /\\nusers. The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages.)\\n\\n25. Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center\\n(including memorial trees, and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the\\nbuildings) be fully identified, maintained, and protected, particularly memorials\\nto veterans. Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained.\\n\\n26. Reserves judgment on the possibility of “daylighting” Strawberry Creek within\\nthe Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted.\\nThe LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies / proposals for\\ndaylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential\\nimpact on the historic design and character of the park in particular. The LPC\\nencourages all, including the City and private groups, studying daylighting to\\ntake into account two key issues: preserving the overall physical framework /\\nhistoric character / design of the Civic Center; ensuring ample and adequate access\\nfor the public, especially for disabled t users, to the buildings and outdoor spaces of\\nthe Civic Center.\\n\\nPage 5 of 5'}\n",

It has recently come to our attention that Berkeley City\\nCouncilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new resolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose\\n\\nJapan’s planned discharge of objectively harmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nAs a Berkeley-based environmental research institution with staff possessing special expertise in oceanography and\\nnuclear power plant safety, we find this proposed resolution to be a senseless distraction for the city’s public agenda\\nthat is at best political grandstanding, and at worst environmentally counterproductive and harmful to social justice.\\n\\nAs we establish in our attached letter, the proposed release of water poses zero risk to public health and environmental\\nsafety off the coast of Japan, and certainly for Berkeley residents and businesses. We show that a person drinking\\nnothing but the treated water for an entire year would experience a fraction of the equivalent of a chest X-ray\\nprocedure. We emphasize that the International Atomic Energy Agency has determined in their final report, released\\nthis week, that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent with relevant\\ninternational safety standards.”\\n\\nWe have attached our comment on Councilmember Harrison\\'s proposed resolution to this email as a PDF document. —\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nSeaver Wang\\n\\nSeaver Wang, Ph.D. (he/him) J\\nCo-Director, Climate and Energy Program\\n\\nThe Breakthrough Institute\\n\\nseaver@thebreakthrough.org\\n\\nTwitter: @wang seaver\\n\\n\\n----\\nBREA THROUGH\\n\\nINSTITU\\nJuly 06, 2023\\nTo: Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council\\nFrom: Dr. Seaver Wang and colleagues at the Breakthrough Institute\\n\\nSubject: We Strongly Oppose Councilmember Harrison\\'s Symbolic and Non-Scientific Proposed Resolution\\nCriticizing the Government of Japan\\'s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi\\nNuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nAny visitor walking along Berkeley\\'s sunny streets will read the same message posted in front of house after\\nhouse, in window after window: “In this house we believe science is real.” With Berkeley hosting one of the\\nnation’s proudest public universities and a prestigious National Laboratory, this communal respect for the\\nscientific method and for critical analysis should surprise nobody.\\n\\nAs such, we find it highly disappointing that Councilmember Kate Harrison has recently proposed a new\\nresolution calling for the city of Berkeley to formally oppose Japan\\'s planned discharge of objectively\\nharmless wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\\n\\nCouncilmember Harrison\\'s resolution grossly overstates the negligible risks posed by the release of treated\\nwater from the Fukushima facility. If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly\\nfrom the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) fora full year at the planned upper limit\\nconcentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)’, their total added dose of radiation would be\\n0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)?,\\nand approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02\\nmSv).’ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health\\nOrganization\\'s threshold for tritium in drinking water.>\\n\\n1 International Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Review of Safety Related Aspects of Handling ALPS-Treated Water at\\nTEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station: Report 5: Review Mission to NRA.” 2023.\\n\\n* 730.5 liters x 1500 Bq/L x 1.8E-11 Sv/Bq (dose coefficient for tritium, in Sv/Bq, from Radiological Aspects.

Needless to say, the vast\\nPacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at\\nFukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific\\nmeasurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring\\nbackground radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report\\nreviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy\\n\\n_ Agency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent\\nwith relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and I at the Breakthrough Institute would be\\nhappy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that\\nthe water is entirely safe. )\\n\\nBy the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation\\nprocess requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any\\nremaining additional radioactivity from the release. Clearly, Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s claim that the\\nrelease “could impact millions of lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region” and “imposes considerable\\nrisks to environmental and human rights across the globe” amounts to nothing but sheer political theater.\\nThe risk to Berkeley “residents and businesses\" is, quite literally, zero.\\n\\nWe further note that many of the experts and organizations that Councilmember Harrison has chosen to\\nquote represent explicitly anti-nuclear advocacy groups, including Greenpeace International, Friends of the\\nEarth, and No Nukes Action. These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained .\\nideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against\\nclimate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize\\nnuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison’s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically\\nrigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support\\nclean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources\\nin decarbonizing the global energy system.®\\n\\n_ In response to Councilmember Harrison\\'s invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear\\nmisinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific\\n\\n6 international Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Finds Japan’s Plans to Release Treated Water into the Sea at\\nFukushima Consistent with International Safety Standards.” July 4, 2023. °\\nhttps://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-finds-japans-plans-to-release-treated-water-into-the-sea-at-\\nfukushima-consistent-with-international-safety-standards.

Do not click links or r attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is\\nsafe.\\nDear Mayor Arreguin and members of the Berkeley City Council: ~\\n\\n| am writing on behalf of Nikkei Resisters and as someone who lived and now works in the city of Berkeley, to\\nurge you to adopt by consent the Resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the\\nGovernment of Japan's Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into\\nthe Pacific Ocean (Consent Item #29)” at tomorrow's Council meeting.\\n\\nThe government of Japan and TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) plan to soon begin dumping 1.3\\nmillion tons of nuclear radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. Currents will bring it here and,\\neventually, around the world. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported radionuclides from\\nFukushima across the Pacific to California. Moreover, traces of Fukushima radiation have been detected off\\nthe coast of California since 2015. 70% of the water supposedly “treated” with the ALPS (Advanced Liquid\\nProcessing System) which TEPCO claims to be safe does not meet International regulatory standards for\\ndischarge. Strontium-90, one of the radionuclides found in the “treated” water, is among the most hazardous\\nradionuclides; once in the body, Strontium-90 acts like calcium and is readily incorporated into bones and\\nteeth, where it can cause the cancers of bone, bone marrow, and soft tissues around the bone. TEPCO’s\\n“safety” claim does not take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a\\nhuman body; once it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell\\nmutations. Because of TEPCO’s inadequate sampling practices, lack of data on what the water actually\\ncontains, and lack of analysis on the transboundary issues, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of the\\ndischarge, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of\\nHawaii at Manoa, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.\\n\\nThe people ¢ of Japan and neighboring nations such as Korea, China, the Philippines, as well as the Pacific -\\nIsland nations, overwhelmingly oppose the dumping. The Pacific Islands Forum assembled a working group of\\ninternational, independent, interdisciplinary scientists and experts to research alternatives and figure out the\\nbest solution, which is to solidify the contaminated water which will remain on site and, therefore, will have very\\nlittle contact with humans. While it may not be the perfect solution, the cement encasement is far safer than\\ndumping it in the ocean; the cement will contain the tritium and it will not be released.\\n\\nThe IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) which has approved the plan, has a contradictory dual\\npurpose of regulating nuclear energy and promoting the nuclear energy industry at the same time. For this\\nreason, the IAEA is often seen as biased. An internal IAEA document recently leaked by a whistleblower\\nsuggests that the agency has been colluding with the government of Japan by withholding certain data from\\nthe final report at the request of the Japanese government.\\n\\nit is our moral obligation to leave our oceans in as pristine a condition as possible for future »\\ngenerations. | urge you to vote in support of the resolution “Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company |\\nand the Government of Japan’s Planned Discharge of Wastewater from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power\\n\\n‘ Plant into the Pacific Ocean” at an upcoming city council meeting on July 11th, on behalf of concerned\\ncitizens like myself.\\n\\n----\\nThank you to Council Member Harrison for being the author on the consent item.\\nSincerely,\\nMiya Sommers\\n\\nMiya Sommers\\nmiyasommers@gmail.com\"},\n",

I am concerned that this value if far greater than what\\nmight actually be required for comprehensive ecological restoration, so I have\\nprepared the following diagrams to provide a mote realistic reference for evaluating\\nthe potential for restoring Strawberry Creek at Civic Center Park.\\n\\nThe first drawing is a conceptual cross section that assumes the existing culvert\\ninvert is 18’ below the surface. Based on this depth and empirical data of the\\nStrawberry Creek channel geometry on the UC Berkeley campus, we prepared what I\\nwould consider a minimal creek corridor width. I included typical stream bank\\ntreatments such as armored “cut banks”, 2:1 slopes, small terracing walls, public\\naccess paths, and a small amount of floodplain.\\n\\nThe exercise produced a 76’ right-of-way width. The second drawing was prepared\\nto show what that 76’ width would represent in plan-view when placed over Civic\\nCenter Park. Together, these drawings are intended to provide a more tealistie\\ndepiction of a restored creek and right-of-way requirements.\\n\\nI should add that the right-of-way I depicted is intended to represent a minimum\\nwidth but could be further narrowed in locations if necessary to “fit” the restored\\nchannel into the site and accommodate other park uses. It may also be appropriate\\nto widen the creek right-of-way in other locations to better integrate the resource\\ninto the broader park program.\\n\\nI believe that at this time it is critical that the Berkeley City Council adopt language\\nthat emphasizes the need for \"full restoration,\" and that allows for the consideration\\nof alternatives for ecologically viable alternatives at this site. I hope that these\\ndrawings provide a more credible starting point for such discussions and the\\nevaluation of more specific design alternatives.\\n\\nA full planning and design grant from a state agency for the restoration of\\nStrawberry Creek would offer a quantitative series of alternatives that would\\nconform to site conditions and offer a series of options for stream design.\\n\\n----\\nDrawing A Conceptual Section: Note that this drawing is only partially illustrated,\\nand a restored creek would have native vegetation on both banks.\\n\\nCONCEPTUAL SECTION. 06 July, 2023\\nSTRAWBERRY CREEK | City of Berkeley Restoration Design Group, Inc.\\n\\nDrawing B.

Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the\\nsender and know the content is safe.\\n\\nDear Council:\\n\\nWe at the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum (BHSM) are pleased that the Civic Center\\nplanning has moved along this far, and we want to encourage you to vote to proceed. to the next\\nphase. It is important that BHSM continue to have a large enough space in the downtown area to\\nserve its mission: to foster appreciation and understanding of our city’s unique history by residents\\nand visitors alike through research, collection, preservation, exhibition and publication of historical\\nrecords, photographs, artifacts and other media. ;\\n\\nAlthough a first-floor location in the Maudelle Shirek Building would have more prominence, there are\\nadvantages to the current plan, which gives us the ground floor of the existing building plus wall\\nspace for exhibits on the other levels. We would like to see renovation of the Shirek Building take\\nplace first so that we can move there before operations in the Veterans Building need to be shut\\ndown. We understand that we will need to raise funds for the interior finishes, furnishings and\\n-equipment for BHSM spaces.\\n\\nAs you may know, the Berkeley Historical Society was established in 1978 in conjunction with\\nBerkeley’s centennial. (There had been some earlier efforts toward a city history museum in the City\\nHall and the Acheson Building, and at one point in the 1980s we almost moved into the former City\\nHall.) We are now approaching the Society’s 50th anniversary and the city’s sesquicentennial in\\n2028. Since 1992 the Society has leased space in the Veterans Memorial Building. It is thirty years\\nthis month since we opened our first exhibit there in July 1993, and it seems the building has received\\nminimal maintenance by the City since then. The main floor is overheated in the winter, the second\\nfloor has no heat, and the public restrooms are in pitiful condition.\\n\\nThe Shirek Building has also been inadequately maintained; for example, peeling paint on its exterior\\nwoodwork will cause further damage. While efforts continue toward planning major seismic work and\\nrenovations to take place at some point in the future, we hope the City staff can find a way to attend\\nto some of these two buildings’ sore needs in the meantime.\\n\\nFor several years we have been sending each of you our + quarterly newsletter containing articles .\\nabout Berkeley history. (If you would like it to go to your home address, please let me know.) We\\nhope you have been able to read at least some issues and visit some of our exhibits and events. We\\nalso encourage you to explore our new website, berkhistory.org.\\n\\n~ We look forward to working in partnership with the City and the Community for a Cultural Civic Center\\non bringing an exciting new vision for ine Civic Center complex into reality.

By and large, from a preservation standpoint, the process has’\\nworked and the direction of the recommendations by consultants is generally sensitive to\\nhistoric issues. We provide the following comments as context for your deliberations on\\nnext steps. The Landmarks Preservation Commission specifically:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nCalls for and supports, as a general principle, the restoration, refurbishment, and\\nsensitive adaptive re-use of the two historic buildings in the Civic Center and\\nthe park, rather than their radical replacement, demolition, or alteration;\\n\\nsupports continuation of a joint subcommittee of Commission representatives\\nconnected to the Civic Center (including the LPC, Civic Arts, Parks & Waterfront,\\nDisability, and Transportation / Public Works). The ongoing subcommittee has been,\\nand should remain, a useful place to cooperatively discuss civic center issues,\\ninteract with staff, consultants, and the public, and advise the Council on planning\\nproposals and projects for the Civic Center. The subcommittee can particularly serve\\nas a sounding board and anchor for the proposed 2024-2027 “research, schematic\\ndesign and approvals funding plan, design development” phase;\\n\\nsupports, and strongly urges the Council to actively prioritize and proceed with\\nfurther planning and identification of funding for the renovation of the Shirek\\nBuilding and the Veterans Building, particularly funding for seismic\\nstrengthening. There should be no substantial pause in planning. These are highly\\nimportant structures that are both historic and useful, and the City should make it a\\nhigh priority to bring both of them back into full use. Both buildings are currently living\\non borrowed time, given the high and growing likelinood of a major earthquake in the\\nBay Area;\\n\\nPage 1 of 5\\n\\n----\\n. supports full accessibility for the buildings, with a design approach that also\\nminimizes impacts / alterations to the main facades. If the zig-zag ramp on the\\nfront of the Veterans Building were to be redesigned / modified or replaced use of the\\nState Historic Building Code should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to\\nbetter harmonize with the historic front steps / facade;\\n\\n. supports recommendations of the consultant / staff reports that emphasize .\\nrestoration and refurbishment of the historic buildings, both inside and out,\\nincluding original finishes, details, and maintaining general historic interior\\nlayout. The two buildings should be sensitively renovated and for full use through\\nadaptive design, as opposed to insensitive gutting and replacement of the interiors.\\nUse of the State Historic Building Code should be used to the greatest extent\\npossible. .\\n\\n. supports, in concept, the addition of infill structures placed behind the two\\nbuildings to expand their useable square footage. Additions should be\\ndesigned and detailed so they follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and\\ndo not detract from, compete with, or alter the principal facades of the historic\\nbuildings;\\n\\n. supports study and planning that would add maximum sized infill structures to\\none or both courtyards of the Veterans Building. Courtyard infill would\\nconsiderably expand the useable space within the building and its functionality for a\\nlarge number of simultaneous arts events and activities, and is also best\\nconstructed in conjunction with overall building renovations. The courtyards are\\nnear-ideal locations for infill structures since new construction there would not have\\nan impact on the visible exterior appearance of the building;\\n\\n. supports the consultant suggestion of adding a deck / event space to the roof\\n_ of the Veterans Building, so long as it is designed in such a way that it is\\nconcealed behind the roof parapet and recedes above and behind the historic\\nfacade, especially when seen from across the park;\\n\\n. supports primary use of the Veterans Building for civic arts uses, including\\nperforming arts and visual arts. Supports the broadest possible access of arts\\nand community groups to the building, rather than exclusive or extensive use of\\nthe building for / by a small number of groups / organizations;\\n\\nPage 2 of 5\\n\\n----\\n10. supports primary use of the Maudelle Shirek Building (Berkeley’s original town\\n\\n1\\n\\n—\\n\\n12.\\n\\n13.\\n\\n14.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nhall) for City and civic meeting and educational use, including maximizing the\\nprovision of flexible meeting spaces suitable for gatherings of many sizes, so\\nseveral meetings can take place at the same time in different parts of the building,\\nand so facilities are provided for hybrid meetings that seamlessly combine virtual\\nand in-person participation;\\n\\n. supports inclusion of facilities in the Shirek Building for use by Berkeley\\n\\nCommunity Media and the Berkeley Historical Society & Museum (BHSM).\\nBoth uses are compatible with the history / use of the building. Berkeley\\nCommunity Media also provides support for civic meetings (such as broadcast of\\nCouncil and Commission meetings), while BHSM’s proposed operation of a\\nmuseum and history research center would bring users to the building;\\n\\nsupports City encouragement for a variety of community groups and city\\nprograms interested in local history (such as the History Room in the Public\\nLibrary) to work cooperatively to make the Shirek Building a “one-stop” center\\nof local historical education, research, display, and archives;\\n\\nsupports, in particular, the preservation and re-use of specific key historic\\nspaces in both buildings including: within the Veterans Building, the fine\\nauditorium, and four lodge / meeting rooms, and extensive lobby; within the\\nMaudelle Shirek Building, the interior halls and grand staircase, and the\\nhistoric Council Chambers on the upper floor (the Council Chamber room is\\ncurrently proposed as a large hearing room for civic and other meetings such as |\\nCommissions that expect a considerable audience).\\n\\nsupports the creation of a new, large, multipurpose room addition to the rear of\\nthe Shirek Building that can accommodate City Council meetings and large\\nCommission meetings, as well as serve as space for other types of meeting use\\nand activities. The room should be designed flexibly without fixed / built-in seating\\nor furniture, so it can be easily and quickly adapted to multiple uses;\\n\\nencourages consideration of moving Berkeley’s Visitor Center to the Shirek\\nBuilding to bring more users, tourists, and visitors to the Civic Center;\\n\\nPage 3 of 5\\n\\n----\\n16.\\n\\n17.\\n\\n18.\\n\\n19.\\n\\n20.\\n\\n21\\n\\nPe.\\n\\nencourages providing both buildings with ‘catering kitchens’ and support\\ninfrastructure so appropriate spaces within them can be used flexibly for civic and\\nrental events such as receptions, social gatherings, and even meals / dinner events;\\n\\ncalls for, and supports creation of, a comprehensive interpretive signage and\\nwebsite program that would educate the public about the history and\\ndevelopment of the Civic Center; |\\n\\nopposes transferring any substantial amount of existing City office space from\\nelsewhere in the Civic Center to the Shirek Building or Veterans Building. This\\nwould do little or nothing to activate the Civic Center with additional uses / users,\\nand would reduce the availability and usability of the buildings for broader active\\nuses. In addition, an approach that emphasizes “more city staff offices” will simply\\nnot resonate with the general public and voters whose support will be essential to\\nfuture Civic Center renovations; discourages any pre-reservation or design of space\\nin the buildings for programs that do not currently exist;\\n\\nnotes that the Veterans Building was specifically constructed for the use of local\\nveterans organizations, which were large and active at the time it was built.\\nPermanent reuse plans should recognize that origin and history and provide a\\nmeans for remaining or future Berkeley veterans organizations to have\\nongoing and affordable access to meeting / event space in the Civic Center;\\n\\nencourages the City to plan, renovate, and manage the Civic Center buildings\\nso they can be rented—when not in civic uses such as public meetings or\\ncommunity arts events—for uses, both small and large, from concerts, festivals,\\nand fairs to meetings, conventions, and conferences. If effectively designed and\\nmanaged the Civic Center overall can be the location Berkeley has long needed to\\nhold conferences and events, while also producing income for the City;\\n\\n. encourages the City and the Berkeley Unified School District to work together so\\n\\nthe Community Theater on the Berkeley High School campus, which is the\\nlargest indoor theater space in Berkeley, can be restored and integrated into\\nCivic Center activities and use;\\n\\ngenerally supports a design of the park that prioritizes maintaining maximum green\\nspaces and existing trees, provides unobtrusive infrastructure (bathrooms, power\\n\\nPage 4 of 5\\n\\n----\\nsources, lighting, etc.) to support multiple uses, emphasizes not only event use, but\\nsupports active day to day use of the park spaces by a wide variety of users, reuses\\nrather than unnecessarily demolishes, existing hardscape, emphasizes the park as a\\nharmonious, historic, and generally symmetrical civic space, and brings water back\\nto the fountain; discourages any redesign or physical renovation of the park that\\nunnecessarily detracts from its historic character or is not important for future\\nfunctionality; :\\n\\n23.Emphatically supports removal of the intrusive and non-historic parking lot\\nbehind 2180 Milvia, at the east end of the park, and supports integration of this\\narea into the park space overall. A portion of this area could (as plans currently\\npropose) remain hardscape, not for daily parking, but for use as a Staging area for\\nlarger events within the park;\\n\\n24.supports park design that provides facilities and infrastructure for large\\ngatherings, festivals, and similar events. Opposes construction of new\\npermanent structures (particularly buildings) in the park space, and encourages\\nevent facilities to be designed unobtrusively (for example, it should be planned and\\npossible for temporary event stages to be erected in the park, but building big\\noutdoor permanent stage is not desirable since it could displace everyday uses /\\nusers. The consultant recommendations do not propose any permanent stages.)\\n\\n25. Urges that all existing historic markers and features within the Civic Center\\n(including memorial trees, and memorials incorporated in or affixed to the\\nbuildings) be fully identified, maintained, and protected, particularly memorials\\nto veterans. Damaged memorials should be restored and maintained.\\n\\n26. Reserves judgment on the possibility of “daylighting” Strawberry Creek within\\nthe Civic Center until specific design concepts are further explored and vetted.\\nThe LPC looks forward with interest to any specific studies / proposals for\\ndaylighting the Creek and will need to evaluate such proposals for their potential\\nimpact on the historic design and character of the park in particular. The LPC\\nencourages all, including the City and private groups, studying daylighting to\\ntake into account two key issues: preserving the overall physical framework /\\nhistoric character / design of the Civic Center; ensuring ample and adequate access\\nfor the public, especially for disabled t users, to the buildings and outdoor spaces of\\nthe Civic Center.\\n\\nPage 5 of 5'},\n",

In my church the sharing of —\\nsacraments is a sacred act, equivalent of the sharing of the Host in Christian churches, or the\\nsharing of the Seder plate in Judaism. This second resolved statement will complicate, if not\\nprohibit, that practice and infringe on our rights to practice our faith in the full freedom granted\\nto us under our Constitution. | therefore plead with you to remove that clause to allow our\\nmembers to.practice their faith without undue complications. :\\n\\nThank you for considering the decriminalization of these sacred plants and removing restrictions\\non their use. Hundreds of thousands, and historically, millions, have found healing with these\\nsacred medicines, and your courage in allowing people to work with these plants as they feel need\\nwill add to the growing movement to bring this unspeakably inhumane, infantilizing and |\\ndestructive, even criminal, “War on Drugs” under which the country has suffered for far too long.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nClifton Ross\\nBerkeley, CA\\n\\nMy political memoir, Home from the Dark Side of Utopia, is now available from AK Press.
