Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is\\nsafe.\\n\\nMy name is Tsukuru Fors. | am an anti-nuclear/human rights activist based in Los Angeles, California. | grew\\nup in Hiroshima, Japan, and am a graduate of a high school where 350 young lives were brutally taken on\\nAugust 6, 1945. Spending my formative years surrounded by people who were directly affected by the\\nintergenerational traumas of the atrocity has prompted me to advocate for all victims of nuclear disasters\\nglobally in the past and present.\\n\\n| have been made aware of the recent efforts to discredit a resolution championed by councilmember Kate\\nHarrison to oppose TEPCO/the government of Japan’s plan of dumping radioactive wastewater from the\\ncrippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In the letter that was addressed to city council members to\\ndiscourage them from voting yes on the resolution, the recent approval issued by the IAEA (International\\nAtomic Energy Agency) was cited. | felt the need to respond to that. ,\\n\\n| am not going to debate the validity of the IAEA report/approval here. Rather, once again | would like to cite\\nthe findings published by a board of five experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum. The findings\\npoint out that TEPCO has neither done enough due- “diligence nor yr provided enough data to ascertain the safety\\nof the proposed plan.\\n\\nAmong the critical failings with TEPCO's “safety” claim, two things stand out to me. One is their lack of analysis\\nwith regards to the transboundary issues. Wastewater released by Japan is not going to stay in and around\\nJapan; therefore, the concerns of neighboring nations such as South Korea, the Philippines, China, and the\\nPacific Island nations should be seriously considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the potential —\\nrisks are not limited to the Asia-Pacific region. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported\\nradionuclides from Fukushima across the Pacific to California.\\n\\nThe other is the matter of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration. Radionuclides such as Tritium and Strontium\\n90 can pass various levels of the food chain and be “bio-accumulated.” The higher up the food chain, the\\nhigher the level of the contamination. In fish like Cod that are relatively high up in the food chain, the\\nconcentration can be 2,000-6,000 times higher than the level naturally found in the water. TEPCO’s claim does\\nnot take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a human body, either:\\nonce it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell mutations.\\nBecause of these failings, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the\\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa and who is among the board of experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands\\nForum, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.\\n\\nLastly, | would like to appeal to the moral and ethical responsibility that we have, as citizens of the United\\nStates, to the people of the Pacific Island nations and future generations worldwide. The question that | want\\nus to ask ourselves is this: should we be treating the oceans as a dumping ground? Haven't the world’s oceans\\nbeen polluted and stressed enough? The people of the Pacific Island nations have been victimized for decades\\nby the nuclear ambitions of more “powerful” nations. For Japan to release wastewater from the damaged\\n\\nf\\n\\n----\\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is a gross disregard for their livelihood and ocean way of life. For us,\\ncitizens of the United States, not to oppose such’a plan is to be complicit in the act of nuclear colonialism.\\n\\n| was born and raised in Japan but immigrated to the United States of America. | have raised my child here and\\nenjoyed the beaches and the ocean as a resident of California. It is my obligation to do everything in my power\\nto protect the environment and leave it as clean as possible for future generations. | am pleading to you,\\nhonorable members of the Berkeley City Council, to act on your conscience and to do your part in being good\\nstewards of our planet.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nTsukuru Fors\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nOver 70 percent of Fukushima Waste Water Fails Discharge Limits and Needs More Treatment, Says China's\\nNuclear Watchdog | ,\\n\\nhttps:/Awww.scm com/news/china/science/article/3226667/over-70-cent-fukushima-waste-water-fails-\\n\\ndischarge-limits-and-needs-more-treatment-says-chinas ?fbclid=lwAR3u SqwpBdGgGB-\\nDN8Pm10YYVOd6BVgS0OMm _IsS5oc30nEFG3Qx9Z5q5GbU ;\\n\\n[AEA rubber-stamped release of radioactive Fukushima water without finishing sample analysis\\n\\nhttps://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e international/1099039.htmI?fbclid=lwAR3hGihH-\\nMmD4wO48ceMW-oiX6lGuQgS 1Fa2PULKQ7ify7 kxKx8J28SUhM\\n\\nStatement: Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General Henry Puna on the Fukushima Treated Waste Water\\n\\nhttos:/Awww.forumsec. org/2023/06/26/statement-pacific-islands-forum-secretary-general-henry- una-on-the-\\n\\nfukushima-treated-nuclear-wastewater/?fbclid=lwAR2ptXiL-\\nkafTGI7l45n56BukfWiox4xAT/3tBRvctviznLgoQUifPMpFUo\"}\n",

Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is\\nsafe.\\n\\nDear Jesse Arreguin, Kate Harrison, Rashi Kesarwani, Terry Taplin, Ben Bartlett, Sophie Hahn, Susan Wengraf,\\n\\nRigel Robinson and Mark Humbert,\\n\\n| hope this email finds you well. | am writing to express my strong support for Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s decision\\nto include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s Planned Discharge of\\nWastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on tomorrow\\'s agenda at the\\nCalifornia Berkeley City Council. |\\n\\nAs a concerned citizen who respects and honors representatives sensitive to the needs of our planet, we must act in\\nsolidarity with our friends in this crucial matter. Recently, Tokyo Electric Power Company announced its intention to\\nmove forward with discharging radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This development has\\nprompted various groups worldwide to unite and voice their concerns regarding the protection of our oceans.\\n\\nIn caring for and safeguarding our marine ecosystems, countries like Korea, Pacific Islands nations, numerous\\ninstitutions, global NGOs, and thousands of fishers have assumed the responsibility of creating educational awareness,\\nexploring alternative solutions, and seeking political resolutions. It is against this backdrop that the California Berkeley\\nCity Council will be voting on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s\\nPlanned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n| urge you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences shared during the Council meeting, as they may\\nshape a better future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among other organizations, will present valuable\\ninformation that can contribute to informed decision-making.\\n\\nIn light of the gravity of the situation, | recommend that the California Berkeley City Council adopts the Resolution\\nopposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan\\'s plan to discharge wastewater from the\\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | suggest that copies of this resolution be\\nsent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative Barbara Lee, in order to\\nraise awareness and garner support at the federal level.\\n\\nIt is crucial to consider the background surrounding this issue. Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima disaster\\nreached California\\'s shores in 2015, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO\\'s plan to release\\nadditional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as soon as Spring of 2023. This proposed discharge raises alarming\\nconcerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has been\\nconducted to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts have argued that TEPCO and the government of\\nJapan are proceeding without a proper understanding of the potential risks involved.\\n\\nWhile TEPCO and the government of Japan assert that the wastewater has been treated and poses no environmental or\\nhealth risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Many marine biologists, marine pollution experts, and scientists\\nhave highlighted significant shortcomings in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the \"Advanced Liquid\\nProcessing System\" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site. This system is incapable of removing all\\nradioactive materials before the release.\\n\\n----\\nFurthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights\\nCouncil expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives\\nand livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the considerable risks posed to environmental and human rights\\nglobally.\\n\\nIt is important to note that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the\\n\\n_ government of Japan\\'s planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By joining the\\nCity of West Hollywood and tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of Berkeley can reaffirm its\\nposition as a global environmental leader, committed to protecting our planet\\'s natural resources.\\n\\nIn conclusion, | implore you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s initiative and take a stand against the planned\\ndischarge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By adopting the\\nproposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental\\nstewardship and send a powerful message to decision-makers at all levels.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will consider the scientific evidence, environmental\\nimplications, and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please let me know if there is any\\nadditional information or support | can provide.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nTorrance Carroll\\n20 S 2nd St. Unit 227\\nSan Jose, CA 95113\\n\\ntorrancecarroll@gmail.com'}\n",

If the average person were to drink 2 liters of water per day directly\\nfrom the planned Fukushima releases (following desalination) for a full year at the planned upper limit\\nconcentration of 40,500 picocuries/liter (1500 bequerels/L)!, their total added dose of radiation would be\\n0.0197 millisieverts (Sv)’, the equivalent of less than one-fifth the dose of a medical chest X-ray (0.1 mSv)’,\\nand approximately the added radiation exposure from a single 5-hour coast-to-coast airline flight (0.02\\nmSv).‘ The planned Fukushima release is already around just one-seventh of the World Health\\nOrganization’s threshold for tritium in drinking water.°\\n\\n1 international Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Review of Safety Related Aspects of Handling ALPS-Treated Water at\\nTEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station: Report 5: Review Mission to NRA.” 2023.\\n\\n2 730.5 liters x 1500 Bq/L x 1.8E-11 Sv/Bq (dose coefficient for.tritium, in Sv/Bq, from Radiological Aspects.

Needless to say, the vast\\nPacific Ocean is approximately 700,000,000,000 times larger in volume than all the stored wastewater at\\nFukushima, which would in any event only be released gradually over the span of decades. Scientific\\nmeasurements will struggle to detect any signal from the released water relative to naturally-occuring\\nbackground radiation in seawater even within a few tens of kilometers of the release. In their final report\\nreviewing the safety of water treated at the Fukushima power plant, the International Atomic Energy -\\nAgency determined that the planned release will “have a negligible radiological impact” and is “consistent\\nwith relevant international safety standards.”® My colleagues and Tat the Breakthrough Institute would be\\nhappy to drink the treated water, if provided, at a future City Council meeting to publicly demonstrate that\\nthe water is entirely safe...\\n\\nBy the time any water molecules from the coast of Japan reach the coast of California, a oceanic circulation\\nprocess requiring around 2-3 years,’ no scientific instrument on Earth will be able to distinguish any\\nremaining additional radioactivity from the release.

These single-mindedly traditionalist activist organizations have remained\\nideologically opposed to the promise of clean nuclear energy for helping societies worldwide act against\\nclimate change. Their critique of the planned Fukushima release is primarily intended to stigmatize\\nnuclear energy. Councilmember Harrison\\'s draft resolution meanwhile ignores a vast array of scientifically\\nrigorous and open-minded researchers, more forward-thinking advocates, and institutions that support\\nclean nuclear power as a critical tool alongside wind, solar, batteries, and other low-carbon energy sources\\nin decarbonizing the global energy system.® .\\n\\nIn response to Councilmember Harrison’s invocation of social justice, we assert that anti-nuclear\\nmisinformation represents the far larger and more real injustice faced by Japanese, Asian, and Pacific\\n\\n© International Atomic Energy Agency. “IAEA Finds Japan’s Plans to Release Treated Water into the Sea at\\nFukushima Consistent with International Safety Standards.” July 4, 2023.\\nhttps://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-finds-japans-plans- -to- release-treated-water-into-the- -Sea-at-\\nfukushima-consistent-with-international-safety-standards.\\n\\n7 “Ocean Surface Currents | Manoa.

As a concerned citizen of Berkeley, | believe it is crucial for our city to take a stand against this\\ndecision and protect the health and environment of our coastal waters. |\\n\\nThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as you are aware, experienced a catastrophic meltdown following the\\n2011 earthquake and tsunami.

The potential\\necological damage cannot be underestimated, as radioactive isotopes could harm marine organisms, disrupt\\nthe delicate balance of ecosystems, and have far-reaching consequences for the health of our oceans.\\n\\nSafer alternatives exist, including safe storage and radioactive decay, bioremediation, and use of treated water\\nto make concrete for special applications (the latter option has been proposed by the Independent Expert\\n\\nPanel to the Pacific Islands Forum.

As a concerned citizen of Berkeley, | believe it is crucial for our\\ncity to take a stand against this decision and protect the health and environment of our coastal\\nwaters.\\n\\nThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as you are aware, experienced a catastrophic meltdown\\nfollowing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The resulting contamination of water in the plant's\\nstorage tanks has. posed an ongoing challenge for the Japanese government. However, | firmly\\nbelieve that releasing this contaminated water into the ocean will have severe health and\\nenvironmental consequences, not only for Japan but also for coastal regions as far away as\\nCalifornia. —\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the release of contaminated water into the ocean poses significant health risks to\\nmarine life and human populations.

Do not click links or attachments unless you trust the sender and know the content is\\nsafe,\\n\\nDear Jesse Arreguin, Kate Harrison, Rashi Kesarwani, Terry Taplin, Ben Bartlett, Sophie Hahn, Susan Wengraf, Rigel\\n\\nRobinson, and Mark Humbert,\\n\\n| hope you\\'re all doing well. I\\'m reaching out to express my enthusiastic support for Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s\\ndecision to include the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s Planned\\nDischarge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean on today\\'s agenda at\\nthe California Berkeley City Council.\\n\\nAs a concerned citizen who deeply values representatives who prioritize our planet\\'s well-being, | believe it\\'s crucial for\\nus to stand united on this important matter. Tokyo Electric Power Company recently made public its intention to release\\nradioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This announcement has sparked global concern and\\nmobilized various groups worldwide to voice their apprehensions regarding the preservation of our precious oceans.\\n\\nNumerous countries, such as Korea and Pacific Islands nations, along with countless institutions, global NGOs, and\\ndedicated fishers, have taken it upon themselves to raise awareness, explore alternative solutions, and pursue political\\navenues to safeguard our marine ecosystems. Against this backdrop, the California Berkeley City Council will soon vote\\non the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s Planned Discharge of\\nWastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n| implore each of you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences that will be shared during the Council\\nmeeting, as they hold the potential to shape a brighter future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among\\nother esteemed organizations, will provide valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making.\\n\\nConsidering the gravity of the situation, | wholeheartedly recommend that the California Berkeley City Council embraces\\nthe Resolution opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan\\'s proposed release of\\nwastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | propose that copies\\nof this resolution be sent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative\\n\\n- Barbara Lee to raise awareness and garner support at the federal level.\\n\\nIt is of utmost importance to consider the context surrounding this issue. Back in 2015, radioactive contamination from\\nthe Fukushima disaster reached California\\'s shores, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO\\'s\\nplan to discharge additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as early as Spring of 2023. This planned release raises\\nserious concerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has\\nbeen undertaken to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts argue that TEPCO and the government of\\nJapan are proceeding without a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks involved.\\n\\nWhile TEPCO and the government of Japan maintain that the wastewater has been adequately treated and poses no\\nenvironmental or health risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Marine biologists, marine pollution experts,\\nand scientists have highlighted significant deficiencies in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the\\neffectiveness of the \"Advanced Liquid Processing System\" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site.\\nRegrettably, this system falls short in its ability to remove all radioactive materials before releasing the wastewater.\\n\\n1\\n\\n----\\nFurthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights\\nCouncil expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives\\nand livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the substantial risks this poses to global environmental and\\nhuman rights. .\\n\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the\\ngovernment of Japan\\'s intended discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By aligning\\nwith the City of West Hollywood and joining the ranks of tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of\\nBerkeley can reassert its position as a leading global environmental advocate, fully committed to preserving our planet\\'s\\ninvaluable resources. .\\n\\nIn conclusion, | implore each of you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s initiative and take a firm stance against\\nthe planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By\\nadopting the proposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can showcase its unwavering dedication to\\nenvironmental stewardship and send a resounding message to decision-makers at all levels.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will conscientiously weigh the scientific evidence,\\nenvironmental implications, and concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please do not hesitate to\\nreach out if there\\'s any additional information or support | can provide.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nDesiree McGill'}\n",

Please see the attached 247\\nsignatures asking the Berkeley City Council to:\\n\\n\"SU pport a full exploration of daylighting Strawberry Creek in Civic Center Park\"\\n\\nLimiting the creek to just a \"partial flow\" could interfere with grant opportunities. We ask that language be\\nadded in the Motion tonight to allow for a full exploration of restoring the creek, to include a potential “full\\n\\nflow design”. Please help us identify a design that can support the many important current (and future) uses\\nof the park while also adding the magic and appeal of a real, natural creek.\\n\\nYouth love the idea of the creek!

There is a proposal for daylighting a portion of Strawberry Creek through the Park, but\\nno assessment of either the current condition of the culvert OR the effect of splitting the park in two\\nby virtue of the daylighting.\\n\\nIn short, there are all sorts of recommendations but these recommendations are indifferent to\\ncosts and vague in presumed benefits.\\n\\nMy view is that Civic Center Park is “underused” except for special-occasions because of its\\nlocation and surroundings.

However, new lesson plans developed as\\npart of the “Cesar Chavez Dolores Huerta Tribute Site Curriculum Project” will include\\nboth in-class and experiential learning at the tribute site on the waterfront at Berkeley’s\\nCésar Chavez Park. The founders of the curriculum project, Santiago Casal and Beatriz\\nLevya-Cutler, aim to “...honor the equitable relationship, work and words of César and\\nDolores and others in the farmworker struggle. The synergy of their partnership is what\\nmade them highly effective.”\\n\\nCasal and Levya-Cutler plan to apply for the Berkeley Public Schools Fund grant,\\nLEARNING for Equity, which provides $1,000 - $15,000 grants to projects focused on\\naddressing systemic oppression through strategic, justice-oriented programming. This\\nfunding would allow complete curriculum implementation across Berkeley schools by\\nSpring 2024. The funds provided by Council discretionary budgets, will help provide\\nsupplemental compensation for teacher leaders who will utilize summer 2023 to develop\\nprototypes and recruit grade-level teacher consultants.

Spending my formative years surrounded by people who were directly affected by the\\nintergenerational traumas of the atrocity has prompted me to advocate for all victims of nuclear disasters\\nglobally in the past and present.\\n\\n| have been made aware of the recent efforts to discredit a resolution championed by councilmember Kate\\nHarrison to oppose TEPCO/the government of Japan’s plan of dumping radioactive wastewater from the\\ncrippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In the letter that was addressed to city council members to\\ndiscourage them from voting yes on the resolution, the recent approval issued by the IAEA (International\\nAtomic Energy Agency) was cited. | felt the need to respond to that. ,\\n\\n| am not going to debate the validity of the IAEA report/approval here. Rather, once again | would like to cite\\nthe findings published by a board of five experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum. The findings\\npoint out that TEPCO has neither done enough due- “diligence nor yr provided enough data to ascertain the safety\\nof the proposed plan.\\n\\nAmong the critical failings with TEPCO's “safety” claim, two things stand out to me. One is their lack of analysis\\nwith regards to the transboundary issues. Wastewater released by Japan is not going to stay in and around\\nJapan; therefore, the concerns of neighboring nations such as South Korea, the Philippines, China, and the\\nPacific Island nations should be seriously considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the potential —\\nrisks are not limited to the Asia-Pacific region. A 2012 study found evidence that bluefin tuna had transported\\nradionuclides from Fukushima across the Pacific to California.\\n\\nThe other is the matter of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration. Radionuclides such as Tritium and Strontium\\n90 can pass various levels of the food chain and be “bio-accumulated.” The higher up the food chain, the\\nhigher the level of the contamination. In fish like Cod that are relatively high up in the food chain, the\\nconcentration can be 2,000-6,000 times higher than the level naturally found in the water. TEPCO’s claim does\\nnot take into consideration the potential impact of OBT (Organically Bound Tritium) on a human body, either:\\nonce it enters the body, OBT can replace water in soft tissues, causing damage to DNA and cell mutations.\\nBecause of these failings, experts like Robert H. Richmond, director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the\\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa and who is among the board of experts commissioned by the Pacific Islands\\nForum, are calling the plan “ill-advised” and premature.\\n\\nLastly, | would like to appeal to the moral and ethical responsibility that we have, as citizens of the United\\nStates, to the people of the Pacific Island nations and future generations worldwide. The question that | want\\nus to ask ourselves is this: should we be treating the oceans as a dumping ground? Haven't the world’s oceans\\nbeen polluted and stressed enough? The people of the Pacific Island nations have been victimized for decades\\nby the nuclear ambitions of more “powerful” nations. For Japan to release wastewater from the damaged\\n\\nf\\n\\n----\\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is a gross disregard for their livelihood and ocean way of life. For us,\\ncitizens of the United States, not to oppose such’a plan is to be complicit in the act of nuclear colonialism.\\n\\n| was born and raised in Japan but immigrated to the United States of America. | have raised my child here and\\nenjoyed the beaches and the ocean as a resident of California.

Recently, Tokyo Electric Power Company announced its intention to\\nmove forward with discharging radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This development has\\nprompted various groups worldwide to unite and voice their concerns regarding the protection of our oceans.\\n\\nIn caring for and safeguarding our marine ecosystems, countries like Korea, Pacific Islands nations, numerous\\ninstitutions, global NGOs, and thousands of fishers have assumed the responsibility of creating educational awareness,\\nexploring alternative solutions, and seeking political resolutions. It is against this backdrop that the California Berkeley\\nCity Council will be voting on the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s\\nPlanned Discharge of Wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n| urge you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences shared during the Council meeting, as they may\\nshape a better future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among other organizations, will present valuable\\ninformation that can contribute to informed decision-making.\\n\\nIn light of the gravity of the situation, | recommend that the California Berkeley City Council adopts the Resolution\\nopposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan\\'s plan to discharge wastewater from the\\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | suggest that copies of this resolution be\\nsent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative Barbara Lee, in order to\\nraise awareness and garner support at the federal level.\\n\\nIt is crucial to consider the background surrounding this issue. Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima disaster\\nreached California\\'s shores in 2015, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO\\'s plan to release\\nadditional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as soon as Spring of 2023. This proposed discharge raises alarming\\nconcerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has been\\nconducted to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts have argued that TEPCO and the government of\\nJapan are proceeding without a proper understanding of the potential risks involved.\\n\\nWhile TEPCO and the government of Japan assert that the wastewater has been treated and poses no environmental or\\nhealth risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Many marine biologists, marine pollution experts, and scientists\\nhave highlighted significant shortcomings in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the \"Advanced Liquid\\nProcessing System\" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site. This system is incapable of removing all\\nradioactive materials before the release.\\n\\n----\\nFurthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights\\nCouncil expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives\\nand livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the considerable risks posed to environmental and human rights\\nglobally.\\n\\nIt is important to note that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the\\n\\n_ government of Japan\\'s planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By joining the\\nCity of West Hollywood and tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of Berkeley can reaffirm its\\nposition as a global environmental leader, committed to protecting our planet\\'s natural resources.\\n\\nIn conclusion, | implore you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s initiative and take a stand against the planned\\ndischarge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By adopting the\\nproposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can demonstrate its unwavering commitment to environmental\\nstewardship and send a powerful message to decision-makers at all levels.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will consider the scientific evidence, environmental\\nimplications, and the concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please let me know if there is any\\nadditional information or support | can provide.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nTorrance Carroll\\n20 S 2nd St. Unit 227\\nSan Jose, CA 95113\\n\\ntorrancecarroll@gmail.com'},\n",

Tokyo Electric Power Company recently made public its intention to release\\nradioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming weeks. This announcement has sparked global concern and\\nmobilized various groups worldwide to voice their apprehensions regarding the preservation of our precious oceans.\\n\\nNumerous countries, such as Korea and Pacific Islands nations, along with countless institutions, global NGOs, and\\ndedicated fishers, have taken it upon themselves to raise awareness, explore alternative solutions, and pursue political\\navenues to safeguard our marine ecosystems. Against this backdrop, the California Berkeley City Council will soon vote\\non the Resolution Opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Government of Japan\\'s Planned Discharge of\\nWastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n| implore each of you to attentively listen to the stories, data, and experiences that will be shared during the Council\\nmeeting, as they hold the potential to shape a brighter future for our oceans. The Ocean Health Cooperative, among\\nother esteemed organizations, will provide valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making.\\n\\nConsidering the gravity of the situation, | wholeheartedly recommend that the California Berkeley City Council embraces\\nthe Resolution opposing Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the government of Japan\\'s proposed release of\\nwastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, | propose that copies\\nof this resolution be sent to Secretary Blinken, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Alex Padilla, and Representative\\n\\n- Barbara Lee to raise awareness and garner support at the federal level.\\n\\nIt is of utmost importance to consider the context surrounding this issue. Back in 2015, radioactive contamination from\\nthe Fukushima disaster reached California\\'s shores, and on April 13, 2021, the government of Japan announced TEPCO\\'s\\nplan to discharge additional wastewater from the Fukushima Plant as early as Spring of 2023. This planned release raises\\nserious concerns about the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations. Insufficient due diligence has\\nbeen undertaken to ensure the safety of this action, and numerous experts argue that TEPCO and the government of\\nJapan are proceeding without a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks involved.\\n\\nWhile TEPCO and the government of Japan maintain that the wastewater has been adequately treated and poses no\\nenvironmental or health risks, scientific evidence contradicts their claims. Marine biologists, marine pollution experts,\\nand scientists have highlighted significant deficiencies in the due diligence process, particularly regarding the\\neffectiveness of the \"Advanced Liquid Processing System\" (ALPS), the filtration system employed at the Fukushima site.\\nRegrettably, this system falls short in its ability to remove all radioactive materials before releasing the wastewater.\\n\\n1\\n\\n----\\nFurthermore, in April 2021, three independent human rights experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights\\nCouncil expressed their concerns about the impact of the Fukushima Daiichi wastewater dumping on millions of lives\\nand livelihoods in the Pacific region. They emphasized the substantial risks this poses to global environmental and\\nhuman rights. .\\n\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning that on March 6, 2023, the city of West Hollywood passed a resolution opposing TEPCO and the\\ngovernment of Japan\\'s intended discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. By aligning\\nwith the City of West Hollywood and joining the ranks of tens of thousands of concerned citizens worldwide, the City of\\nBerkeley can reassert its position as a leading global environmental advocate, fully committed to preserving our planet\\'s\\ninvaluable resources. .\\n\\nIn conclusion, | implore each of you to support Councilmember Kate Harrison\\'s initiative and take a firm stance against\\nthe planned discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. By\\nadopting the proposed resolution, the California Berkeley City Council can showcase its unwavering dedication to\\nenvironmental stewardship and send a resounding message to decision-makers at all levels.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this pressing matter. | trust that you will conscientiously weigh the scientific evidence,\\nenvironmental implications, and concerns of the global community when casting your vote. Please do not hesitate to\\nreach out if there\\'s any additional information or support | can provide.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nDesiree McGill'},\n",

The Report simply does not engage the costs of renovation of either the Maudelle\\nShirek Old City Hall or the Veterans Building. It has been reasonably established that these costs\\ncould run upward of $80 million.\\n\\nIs the City Council, given all the other infrastructure issues in BEER y prepared to go\\nahead with this proposed expenditure?\\n\\n2. The Report simply does not make an argument for building a new City Council Chamber\\nin the Civic Center. It does not even pretend to do a “cost/benefit” analysis as to why it is necessary\\nor appropriate to move the Council meeting from their current location in the BUSD facility.\\n\\n3. There is a proposal for daylighting a portion of Strawberry Creek through the Park, but\\nno assessment of either the current condition of the culvert OR the effect of splitting the park in two\\nby virtue of the daylighting.\\n\\nIn short, there are all sorts of recommendations but these recommendations are indifferent to\\ncosts and vague in presumed benefits.\\n\\nMy view is that Civic Center Park is “underused” except for special-occasions because of its\\nlocation and surroundings. But that’s a different discussion.\\n\\nThe consultant report is profoundly dishonest and disingenuous. Please scrap it.\\n\\nJack Kurzweil\\n1737 Allston Way'},\n",

If you don't, you might be liable.\\n\\nYou are embarking ona very dangerous path if you deprioritize the enforcement of laws for psilocybin. Several of you\\nare attorneys and should know better.

That was very. scary and dangerous\\nsituation, | believe that the developer Aaran Keifer told the demolishers to start to tear the\\nbuilding down even though he knew we were still inside, we lost over ten thousands dollars of\\ndamage products, including Televisions and other electronics merchandise.......Aran Kiefer talk\\nto you couple of times, but his action on our final days at 2556 Telegraph was wrong......As far\\nas the application we have excellent credit and we have been in business over 50 years as |\\nestablished the business on May 1973 while | was full time graduate student at U C Berkeley\\nNuclear Engineering department, by 1978 when | finished my PHD, Eids Television annual gross\\nsales exceeded 12 million dollars, | did continue my academic life by teaching at Cal for several\\nyears and over one decade at National University in Cupertino, now it is located in San\\n\\nJose.....

Eid, who owns Eid's TV opened his electronics\\nbusiness on North Shattuck around that same time, almost 50 years ago, and he's been in business in\\nBerkeley ever since.\\n\\nAs you know, Eid's is now located on Telegraph just below Dwight Way, and ! understand that the old\\narcade that houses his store is going to be demolished and replaced by a modern building (a damned\\nshame) so Eid is compelled to find another place for his business or close up shop for good if he can't find a\\nsuitable place in central Berkeley to relocate. | understand that retail space was found where Eid could\\nmove his store, and the deal was all but consummated when a problem arose.\\n\\nEid's is a Berkeley institution and it would be a damned shame if he were driven out of business in his\\nbeloved city because of some capricious reason. Berkeley is changing in many ways to keep up with the\\nzeitgeist of the 21st century and that is entirely understandable. But if this city gave in to crass\\ncommercialism and took back the hand it had already extended to help a business that's been in Berkeley\\nfor almost 50 years, that would not be the Berkeley | came to know and love and care about.\\n\\n| entreat you to enable Eid to move his business to the new location that had been previously decided on.\\nYours truly,\\n\\nJane Phillips\\n\\n1501 Blake Street, No. 317\\n\\nj.j. Phillips <jennyhanniver@hotmail.com>\\n\\nHello, Eid,\\n\\nYou don't know me but | pass by your store frequently, on my way to and from the dispensary down the\\nstreet. | also hear you when you call KGO to speak to Pat Thurston, John Rothmann, and the other hosts --\\n| also hear you when you call Michael Krasny on Forum and Minds Over Matter. | always enjoy your calls --\\n\\n----\\nyou invariably have some very interesting and important things to say. | was saddened to hear about the\\ntroubles you're having with your store. It's a shame that the city is going to tear down that unique old\\nbuilding and force you out, but | was encouraged when the other day you said that another place had been\\nfound where you could move your business. But then you called John's show tonight and said that\\nsomeone had blocked the move, even though everybody else had approved it, and you asked people to\\ncontact Jesse Arreguin to protest, so | sent him the email below and | hope the reasons why are evident in\\nthe email.\\n\\n| sincerely hope that whatever the problem is, it will be surmounted so that you can move your store and\\nstay in business here in Berkeley as long as you want.\\n\\nYours truly,\\n\\nJane Phillips\\n\\n\\n----\"}]"
